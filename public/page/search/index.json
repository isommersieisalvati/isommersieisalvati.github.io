[{"content":" 不包括 silm 分别高光了 Maglor 和 Elrond 的名字 有一部分是 Beren 还叫 Maglor 时期的，一并摘录了 手动校对，不保证全对 The Book of Lost Tales (Part 2) Now fare the long days of Elfinesse unto that time when Tuor dwelt in Gondolin; and children then had Dior the Elf,20 Auredhir and Elwing, and Auredhir was most like to his forefather Beren, and all loved him, yet none so dearly as did Dior; but Elwing the fairy have all poesies named as beautiful as Tinúviel if that indeed may be, yet hard is it to say seeing the great loveliness of the elfin folk of yore. Now those were days of happiness in the vales of Hithlum, for there was peace with Melko and the Dwarves who had but one thought as they plotted against Gondolin, and Angband was full of labour; yet is it to tell that bitterness entered into the hearts of the seven sons of Fëanor, remembering their oath. Now Maidros, whom Melko maimed, was their leader; and he called to his brethren Maglor and Dinithel, and to Damrod, and to Celegorm, to Cranthor and to Curufin the Crafty, and he said to them how it was now known to him that a Silmaril of those their father Fëanor had made was now the pride and glory of Dior of the southern vales, “and Elwing his daughter bears it whitherso she goes—but do you not forget,” said he, “that we swore to have no peace with Melko nor any of his folk, nor with any other of Earth-dwellers that held the Silmarils of Fëanor from us. For what,” said Maidros, “do we suffer exile and wandering and rule over a scant and forgotten folk, if others gather to their hoard the heirlooms that are ours?”\nThen went Curufin unto his brethren, and because of their unbreakable oath and of their [?thirst] for that Silmaril (nor indeed was the spell of Mîm and of the dragon wanting) they planned war upon Dior—and the Eldar cry shame upon them for that deed, the first premeditated war of elfin folk upon elfin folk, whose name otherwise were glorious among the Eldalië for their sufferings. Little good came thereby to them; for they fell unawares upon Dior, and Dior and Auredhir were slain, yet behold, Evranin the nurse of Elwing, and Gereth a Gnome, took her unwilling in a flight swift and sudden from those lands, and they bore with them the Nauglafring, so that the sons of Fëanor saw it not; but a host of Dior’s folk, coming with all speed yet late unto the fray, fell suddenly on their rear, and there was a great battle, and Maglor was slain with swords, and Mai….21 died of wounds in the wild, and Celegorm was pierced with a hundred arrows, and Cranthor beside him. Yet in the end were the sons of Fëanor masters of the field of slain, and the brown Elves and the green were scattered over all the lands unhappy, for they would not hearken to Maidros the maimed, nor to Curufin and Damrod who had slain their lord; and it is said that even on the day of that battle of the Elves Melko sought against Gondolin, and the fortunes of the Elves came to their uttermost waning.\nThe seven Sons of Fëanor, their oath (sworn not in Valinor but after the coming of the Noldoli to the Great Lands), and the maiming of Maidros appear in the outlines for Gilfanon’s Tale; and in the latest of these outlines the Fëanorians are placed in Dor Lómin (= Hisilómë, Hithlum), see I.238, 240, 243. Here, in the Tale of the Nauglafring, appear for the first time the names of the Sons of Fëanor, five of them (Maidros, Maglor , Celegorm, Cranthor, Curufin) in the forms, or almost the forms, they were to retain, and Curufin already with his sobriquet ‘the Crafty’. The names Amrod and Amras in The Silmarillion were a late change; for long these two sons of Fëanor were Damrod (as here) and Díriel (here Dinithel or Durithel, see Changes made to Names, p. 245).\nThe Lays of Beleriand Maidros whom Morgoth maimed and tortured is lord and leader, his left wieldeth his sweeping sword; there is swift Maglor , there Damrod and Díriel and dark Cranthir, the seven seekers of their sire’s treasure.\nThen his sons beside him, the seven kinsmen, 120 crafty Curufin, Celegorm the fair, Damrod and Díriel and dark Cranthir, Maglor the mighty, and Maidros tall (the eldest, whose ardour yet more eager burnt than his father’s flame, than Fëanor’s wrath; 125 him fate awaited with fell purpose), these leapt with laughter their lord beside, with linkëd hands there lightly took the oath unbreakable; blood thereafter it spilled like a sea and spent the swords 130 of endless armies, nor hath ended yet:\nThe fixed epithets of certain of the Sons of Fëanor are changed from those in The Children of Húrin (see p. 86): Celegorm is now ‘the fair’ and Maidros ‘the tall’, as they remained; Maglor is ‘the mighty’ (in The Silmarillion ‘the mighty singer’). The line concerning Maidros him fate awaited with fell purpose (126) may show that a form of the story of his end was already in being (in the Tale of the Nauglafring he survived the attack on Dior the Fair but nothing more is told of him), but I think it much more likely that it refers to his capture and maiming by Morgoth.\nAn extraordinary feature of the A-version is the name Celegorm given to the King of the woodland Elves (Thingol); moreover in the next Canto the rôle of Beren is in A played by Maglor , son of Egnor. The only possible conclusion, strange as it is, is that my father was prepared to abandon Thingol for Celegorm and (even more astonishing) Beren for Maglor . Both Celegorm and Maglor as sons of Fëanor have appeared in the Tale of the Nauglafring and in the Lay of the Children of Húrin.\nThe name of the king’s daughter in A, Melilot, is also puzzling (and is it the English plant-name, as in Melilot Brandybuck, a guest at Bilbo Baggins’ farewell party?). Already in the second version of The Children of Húrin Lúthien has appeared as the ‘true’ name of Tinúviel (see p. 119, note to 358–66). It is perhaps possible that my father in fact began the Lay of Leithian before he stopped work on The Children of Húrin, in which case Melilot might be the first ‘true’ name of Tinúviel, displaced by Lúthien; but I think that this is extremely unlikely.* In view of Beren \u0026gt; Maglor , I think Lúthien \u0026gt; Melilot far more probable. In any event, Beren and Lúthien soon appear in the original drafts of the Lay of Leithian.\nA: Maglor his son and other ten.\nA: yet Maglor it was by fortune good who hunting \u0026amp;c. 272 A: till Maglor waking swiftly sought\n317, 329 Maglor A, Beren B\n360 A: proud Maglor fled the forest fast (fast is used in the sense ‘secure against attack’; cf. fastness).\n365 Maglor A, Beren B\nThere are indeed differences in the plot of the Lay from the story told in The Silmarillion (pp. 162 ff.): thus the house where Gorlim saw the phantom of Eilinel was not in the Lay his own; his treachery was far deeper and more deliberate, in that he sought out the servants of Morgoth with the intention of revealing the hiding-place of the outlaws; and he came before Morgoth himself (not Thû-Sauron). But these differences are much outnumbered by the similarities, such as the absence of Maglor -Beren on the fatal day, the apparition of Gorlim coming to him in dream across the water of the lake, the carrion-birds in the alder-trees, the cairn, the seizing of the ring, his friendship with birds and beasts.\nAs regards the names in the A-text: Gorlim and Eilinel were to remain. Maglor -Beren has already been discussed (p. 159). Egnor was still his father, as in the Lost Tales (the emendation to Barahir in the second version of the Tale of Tinúviel, II. 43, was a change made casually years later). Bauglir (which entered during the composition of The Children of Húrin, see p. 52) is changed throughout to Morgoth, but this seems not to have been a rejection of the name, since it appears later in the B-text of the Lay, and survives in The Silmarillion.\nIndications of geography are sparse, and not increased in the B-text. Taur-na-Fuin has been named earlier in B (line 52), but it is not actually said in the present Canto to be the region where the outlaws lurked, though there is no reason to doubt that this is where my father placed it. Coming southwards Maglor -Beren crossed ‘the Shadowy Mountains cold’ (386). The Shadowy Mountains were named several times in The Children of Húrin, where they are the mountains fencing Hithlum, mirrored in the pools of Ivrin, as they are in The Silmarillion. But it would obviously be impossible for Beren to cross the Shadowy Mountains in this application of the name if he were coming out of Taur-na-Fuin and moving south towards Doriath. In the ‘Sketch of the Mythology’ Beren likewise ‘crosses the Shadowy Mountains and after grievous hardships comes to Doriath’, and similarly in the 1930 version; in this latter, however, ‘Mountains of Shadow’ was emended to ‘Mountains of Terror’. It is then clear that in the Lay of Leithian my father was using ‘Shadowy Mountains’ in a different sense from that in The Children of Húrin, and that the Shadowy Mountains of the present Canto are the first mention of Ered Gorgoroth, the Mountains of Terror, ‘the precipices in which Dorthonion [Taur-nu-Fuin] fell southward’ (The Silmarillion p. 95); but the other meaning reappears (p. 234).\nIn A Egnor and his son Maglor (Beren) are Men (e.g. Egnor was ‘a lord of Men’, note to line 128). In the first version of The Children of Húrin Beren was still an Elf, while in the second version my father seems to have changed back and forth on this matter (see pp. 124–5). He had not even now, as will appear later, finally settled the question.\nand he who harps upon the far forgotten beaches and dark shores where western foam for ever roars, Maglor whose voice is like the sea; and Dairon, mightiest of the three.\n509 Maglor A, B; in the rough draft of this passage Ivárë (with Maglor written beside it).\nThe aberrant names in the first two Cantos of A have now disappeared from the text. In the second Canto my father had already given back the name Celegorm to the son of Fëanor (note to line 304), and now Thingol appears in A; Lúthien replaces Melilot; and Beren replaces Maglor . Morgoth now replaces Bauglir in A (see p. 170).\nIn both texts Tinúviel is now explicitly the Elvish word for ‘nightingale’ (line 735; see p. 124); and Maglor , again in both texts, is the name of one of the three greatest singers of Elfinesse: he who harps upon the far forgotten beaches and dark shores where western foam for ever roars, Maglor whose voice is like the sea (506–9)\nIn the rough draft of this passage the name of this minstrel is however Ivárë (though Maglor is written beside it), and Ivárë was named in the Tale of Tinúviel (II. 10), with Tinfang and Dairon, as one of ‘the three most magic players of the Elves’, who ‘plays beside the sea’. This is the first hint of the after-history of Maglor son of Fëanor, who in the Tale of the Nauglafring (II. 241) was slain, as also was Celegorm, in the attack on Dior. The lines in A, omitted in B (note to line 508), are interesting: from England unto Eglamar on rock and dune and sandy bar\nCurufin, Celegorm the fair, Damrod and Díriel were there, and Cranthir dark, and Maidros tall 1630 (whom after torment should befall), and Maglor the mighty who like the sea with deep voice sings yet mournfully.\nNo other player has there been, 45 no other lips or fingers seen so skilled, ’tis said in elven-lore, save Maelor* son of Fëanor, forgotten harper, singer doomed, who young when Laurelin yet bloomed 50 to endless lamentation passed and in the tombless sea was cast.†\n*Both Maglor and Maelor appear in the draft manuscripts of this passage. The final typescript has Maelor , changed to Maglor , but not I think by my father.\nThe Shaping of Middle-Earth Turlin must have been a passing shift from Tuor (cf. the form Tûr that appears in texts of The Fall of Gondolin, II. 148), and Turgon likewise; in the Tale Turgon is of course the name of the King of Gondolin. This curious passing transference of a primary name in the legends may be compared with the brief substitution of Celegorm for Thingol and Maglor for Beren in the Lay of Leithian (III. 159).\nSince the Gnomes or Noldoli afterwards came back into the Great Lands, and these tales deal mostly with them, it may here be said that Lord or King of the Noldoli was Finn. His sons were Fëanor, Fingolfin, and Finrod. Of whom Fëanor was the most skilful, the deepest in lore, Fingolfin the mightiest and most valiant, Finrod the fairest, and the most wisehearted and gentle. The seven sons of Fëanor were Maidros the tall; Maglor a musician and mighty singer whose voice carried far over hill and sea; Curufin the crafty who inherited most of his father’s skill; Celegorm the fair; Cranthir the dark; and Damrod and Díriel who after were great hunters. The sons of Fingolfin were Finweg who was after the king of the Noldoli in the North of the world, and Turgon of Gondolin; and his daughter was Isfin the white. The sons of Finrod were Orodreth, Felagoth, Anrod, and Egnor.\nBut in these days they were kindred and allies. Before the rising of the Sun and Moon Fëanor and his sons marched into the North and sought for Morgoth. A host of Orcs aroused by the burning ships resisted them and was defeated in the First Battle with such loss that Morgoth pretended to treat with them. Fëanor refused, but he was wounded in the fight by a Balrog chief (Gothmog), and died. Maidros the tall, the elder son, induced the Gnomes to meet Morgoth (with as little intent of faith on his side as on Morgoth’s). Morgoth took Maidros captive and tortured him, and hung him from a rock by his right hand. The six remaining sons of Fëanor ( Maglor , Celegorm, Curufin, Damrod, Díriel, and Cranthir) are encamped about the lake Mithrim in Hisilómë (Hithlum, or Dorlómin, the land of shadows in the North-west), when they hear of the march of Finweg and his men1 who have crossed the Grinding Ice. The Sun rises as they march, their blue and silver banners are unfurled, flowers spring beneath the feet of their armies. The Orcs dismayed at the light retreat to Angband. But there is little love between the two hosts of Gnomes encamped now on opposite shores of Mithrim. Vast smokes and vapours are made and sent forth from Angband, and the smoking top of Thangorodrim (the highest of the Iron Mountains around Morgoth’s fortress) can be seen from far away. The North shakes with the thunder under the earth. Morgoth is forging armouries. Finweg resolves to heal the feud. Alone he goes in search of Maidros. Aided by the vapours, which are now floating down and filling Hithlum, and by the withdrawal of Orcs and Balrogs to Angband, he finds him, but cannot release him.\nMaidros forms now a league against Morgoth seeing that he will destroy them all, one by one, if they do not unite. The scattered Ilkorins and Men are gathered together. Curufin and Celegorm despatch a host (but not all they could gather, thus breaking their word) from Nargothrond. The Gnomes of Nargothrond refuse to be led by Finweg, and go in search of the hosts of Maidros and Maglor . Men march up from South and East and West and North. Thingol will not send from Doriath.1 Some say out of selfish policy, others because of the wisdom of Melian and of fate which decreed that Doriath should become the only refuge of the Eldar from Morgoth afterwards. Part was certainly due to the Silmaril, which Thingol now possessed, and which Maidros had demanded with haughty words. The Gnomes of Doriath are allowed2 nonetheless to join the league.\nThis passage, from Curufin and Celegorm despatch a host, was altered by hastily made changes and additions: Curufin and Celegorm come from their wandering; but Orodreth because of Felagund his brother will not come: Thingol also sends but few of his folk. The Gnomes of Fëanor’s sons refuse to be led by Finweg, and the battle is divided into two hosts, one under Maidros and Maglor , and one under Finweg and Turgon. Men march up from South and East and West and North. Thingol sends but few from Doriath.\nBut the ‘Nauglafring’3 remains hoarded secretly in Beren’s keeping. When Mandos let Beren return with Lúthien, it was only at the price that Lúthien should become as shortlived as Beren the mortal. Lúthien now fades, even as the Elves in later days faded as Men grew strong and took the goodness of earth (for the Elves needed the light of the Trees). At last she vanished, and Beren was lost, looking in vain for her, and his son Dior ruled after him. Dior re-established Doriath and grew proud, and wore the ‘Nauglafring’, and the fame of the Silmaril went abroad. After vain bargaining the sons of Fëanor made war on him (the second slaying of Elf by Elf) and destroyed him, and took the ‘Nauglafring’. They quarrelled over it, owing to the curse of the gold, until only Maglor was left. But Elwing daughter of Dior was saved and carried away to the mouth of the river Sirion.4\nThorndor King of Eagles removes his eyries to the Northern heights of the encircling mountains and guards them against Orc-spies.2 On the rocky hill, Amon Gwareth, the hill of watching, whose sides they polish to the smoothness of glass, and whose top they level, the great city of Gondolin with gates of steel is built. The plain all about is levelled as flat and smooth as a lawn of clipped grass to the feet of the hills, so that nothing can creep over it unawares. The people of Gondolin grows mighty, and their armouries are filled with weapons. But Turgon does not march to the aid of Nargothrond, or Doriath, and after the slaying of Dior he has no more to do with the son of Fëanor ( Maglor ).3 Finally he closes the vale to all fugitives, and forbids the folk of Gondolin to leave the valley. Gondolin is the only stronghold of the Elves left. Morgoth has not forgotten Turgon, but his search is in vain. Nargothrond is destroyed; Doriath desolate; Húrin’s children dead; and only scattered and fugitive Elves, Gnomes and Ilkorins, left, except such as work in the smithies and mines in great numbers. His triumph is nearly complete.\nthe son of Fëanor ( Maglor ) \u0026gt; the sons of Fëanor (this goes with the change at the end of §14, note 4).\nTuor growing old2 cannot forbear the call of the sea, and builds Eärámë and sails West with Idril and is heard of no more. Eärendel weds Elwing. The call of the sea is born also in him. He builds Wingelot and wishes to sail in search of his father. Ylmir bids him to sail to Valinor.3 Here follow the marvellous adventures of Wingelot in the seas and isles, and of how Eärendel slew Ungoliant in the South. He returned home and found the Waters of Sirion desolate. The sons of Fëanor learning of the dwelling of Elwing and the Nauglafring had come down on the people of Gondolin. In a battle all the sons of Fëanor save Maidros4 were slain, but the last folk of Gondolin destroyed or forced to go away and join the people of Maidros.5 Elwing cast the Nauglafring into the sea and leapt after it,6 but was changed into a white sea-bird by Ylmir, and flew to seek Eärendel, seeking about all the shores of the world. Their son ( Elrond ) who is half-mortal and half-elfin,7 a child, was saved however by Maidros. When later the Elves return to the West, bound by his mortal half he elects to stay on earth. Through him the blood of Húrin8 (his great-uncle) and of the Elves is yet among Men, and is seen yet in valour and in beauty and in poetry.\n4 Maidros \u0026gt; Maidros and Maglor 5 Written in the margin: Maglor sat and sang by the sea in repentance.\nMaidros and Maglor 4 submit. The Elves set sail from Lúthien (Britain or England) for Valinor.5 Thence they ever still from time [to time] set sail leaving the world ere they fade. On the last march Maglor says to Maidros that there are two sons of Fëanor now left, and two Silmarils; one is his. He steals it, and flies, but it burns him so that he knows he no longer has a right to it. He wanders in pain over the earth, and casts himself into a pit.6 One Silmaril is now in the sea, and one in the earth.7\n4 and Maglor circled in pencil.\n7 Added here: Maglor sings now ever in sorrow by the sea.\nLastly, in the story of Dior and the ruin of Doriath as told in S, there are various developments. The son of Dior, Auredhir (II. 240) has disappeared. The ‘vain bargaining’ between Dior and the Sons of Fëanor perhaps refers to the passage in the Tale (II. 241) where Dior asserts that to return the Silmaril the Nauglafring must be broken, and Curufin (the messenger of the Fëanorians) retorts that in that case the Nauglafring must be given to them unbroken. In the Tale Maglor , Díriel, Celegorm, and Cranthir (or the earlier equivalents of their names) were killed in the battle (which there took place in Hithlum, where Dior ruled after his father); but in S, as first written, the story takes a very strange turn, in that the Fëanorians did get their hands on the Nauglafring, but then so quarrelled over it that in the end ‘only Maglor was left’. How the story would have gone in this case is impossible to discern.\nIn S, the earlier history of Eärendel’s ship-building and shipwrecks in the Fiord of the Mermaid and at Falasquil has, apparently, been abandoned entirely, and Wingelot is his first and only ship; but there remains the motive that Eärendel wishes to seek for his father, whereas Ylmir bids him sail to Valinor (this last being afterwards struck out). His adventures in Wingelot are referred to in S but not otherwise indicated, save for the slaying of Ungoliant ‘in the South’; there is no mention of the Sleeper in the Tower of Pearl. In C the long voyage of Eärendel, accompanied by Voronwë, that finally took them to Kôr, included an encounter with Ungweliantë, though this was after his southern voyage: ‘Driven west. Ungweliantë. Magic Isles. Twilit Isle. Littleheart’s gong awakes the Sleeper in the Tower of Pearl.’ In another outline Eärendel encounters Wirilómë (Gloomweaver) in the South (II. 260). In the account in S he does not on this great voyage come to Kôr, though from it, as in B and C, he returns to ‘the Waters of Sirion’ (the delta) and finds the dwellings there desolate. Now however enters the motive of the last desperate attempt of the Fëanorians to regain the Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien, their descent on the Havens of Sirion, and their destruction. Thus the raid on the Havens has remained, but it is no longer the work of Melko (see II. 258) and is brought into the story of the Oath of Fëanor. As S was first written only Maidros survived; but Maglor was added. (In §14, as written, all the Sons of Fëanor save Maglor were slain at the time of the attack on Dior, though this passage was afterwards struck out. In The Silmarillion Celegorm, Curufin, and Caranthir were slain at that time, and Amrod and Amras (later names of Damrod and Díriel) were slain in the attack on the Havens of Sirion, so that only Maidros and Maglor were left.)\nThe introduction of Elrond in S is of great interest. He has no brother as yet; and he is saved by Maidros (in The Silmarillion, p. 247, Elrond and Elros were saved by Maglor ). When the Elves return into the West he elects to stay ‘on earth’, being ‘bound by his mortal half’. It is most remarkable that although the idea of a choice of fate for the Half-elven is already present, it takes a curiously different form from that which it was to take afterwards, and which became of great importance in The Lord of the Rings; for afterwards, Elrond , unlike his brother Elros Tar-Minyatur, elected to remain an Elf – yet his later choice derives in part from the earlier conception, for he elected also not to go into the West. In S, to choose his ‘elfin half’ seems to have meant to choose the West; afterwards, it meant to choose Elvish immortality.\nIn the story of the fate of the Silmarils, Maglor says to Maidros that there are two sons of Fëanor now left, and two Silmarils. Does this imply that the Silmaril of Beren was lost when Elwing cast herself into the sea with the Nauglafring (unlike the later story)? The answer is certainly yes; the story in S is not comprehensible otherwise. Thus when Maglor casts himself (changed to casts the jewel) into the fiery pit, having stolen one of the Silmarils of the Iron Crown from Fionwë, ‘one Silmaril is now in the sea, and one in the earth’. The third was the Silmaril that remained in Fionwë’s keeping; and it was that one that was bound to Eärendel’s brow. We thus have a remarkable stage of transition, in which the Silmarils have at last achieved primary importance, but where the fate of each has not arrived at the final form; and the conclusion, seen to be inevitable once reached, that it was the Silmaril regained by Beren and Lúthien that became the Evening Star, has not been achieved. In S, Eärendel becomes a star before receiving the Silmaril; but originally, as I have said (II. 265), ‘there is no suggestion that the Valar hallowed his ship and set him in the sky, nor that his light was that of the Silmaril’. In this respect also S is transitional, for at the end the later story appears.\nIn the present version, Eärendel has still not come to his supreme function as the Messenger who spoke before the Powers on behalf of the Two Kindreds, though the birds of Gondolin have been abandoned as the bringers of tidings to Valinor, and Ulmo becomes the sole agent of the final assault on Morgoth out of the West. The voyages of Eärendel have been simplified: he now has the one great voyage–without Voronwë – in Wingelot, in which he slew Ungoliant, and the second voyage, with Voronwë, which takes him to Kôr – and the desertion of Kôr (Tûn) still depends on the March of the Eldar, which has already taken place when he comes there. His voyage into the sky is now achieved by the wings of birds; and the Silmaril still plays no part in his becoming a star, for the Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien was drowned with the Nauglafring at the Mouths of Sirion. But the Silmarils at last become central to the final acts of the mythological drama, and – unlike the later story – only one of the two Silmarils that remained in the Iron Crown is made away with by a son of Fëanor ( Maglor ); the second is given to Eärendel by the Gods, and the later story is visible at the end of S, where his boat ‘is drawn over Valinor to the Outer Seas’ and launched into the Outer Dark, where he sails with the Silmaril on his brow, keeping watch on Morgoth.\nSince the Noldoli afterwards came back into the Great8 Lands, and these tales tell mostly of them, here may be said, using the names in form of Gnomish tongue as it long was spoken on the earth, that King of the Gnomes was Finn.9 His sons were Fëanor, Fingolfin, and Finrod. Of these Fëanor was the most skilful, the deepest in lore of all his race; Fingolfin the mightiest and most valiant; Finrod the fairest and most wise of heart. The seven sons of Fëanor were Maidros the tall; Maglor , a musician and mighty singer whose voice carried far over hill and sea; Celegorm the fair, Curufin the crafty, the heir of well nigh all his father’s skill, and Cranthir the dark; and last Damrod and Díriel, who after were great hunters in the world, though not more than Celegorm the fair, the friend of Oromë. The sons of Fingolfin were Finweg,10 who was after king of the Gnomes in the North of the world, and Turgon of Gondolin; and his daughter was Isfin the White. The sons of Finrod were Felagund, Orodreth, Angrod, and Egnor.\nOf their wanderings and despair, and of the healing of Beren, who ever since has been called Beren Ermabwed the One-handed, of their rescue by Huan, who had vanished suddenly from them ere they came to Angband, and of their coming to Doriath once more, here there is little to tell.11 But in Doriath many things had befallen. Ever things had gone ill there since Lúthien fled away. Grief had fallen on all the people and silence on their songs when their hunting found her not. Long was the search, and in searching Dairon the piper of Doriath was lost, who loved Lúthien before Beren came to Doriath. He was the greatest of the musicians of the Elves, save Maglor son of Fëanor, and Tinfang Warble.12 But he came never back to Doriath and strayed into the East of the world.13\n12 save Maglor son of Fëanor, and Tinfang Warble \u0026gt; and Maglor son of Fëanor and Tinfang Gelion alone are named with him.\nThe dwelling of Elwing at Sirion’s mouth, where still she possessed the Nauglafring and the glorious Silmaril, became known to the sons of Fëanor; and they gathered together from their wandering hunting-paths. But the folk of Sirion would not yield that jewel which Beren had won and Lúthien had worn, and for which fair Dior had been slain. And so befell the last and cruellest slaying of Elf by Elf, the third woe achieved by the accursed oath; for the sons of Fëanor came down upon the exiles of Gondolin and the remnant of Doriath, and though some of their folk stood aside and some few rebelled and were slain upon the other part aiding Elwing against their own lords, yet they won the day. Damrod was slain and Díriel, and Maidros and Maglor alone now remained of the Seven; but the last of the folk of Gondolin were destroyed or forced to depart and join them to the people of Maidros. And yet the sons of Fëanor gained not the Silmaril; for Elwing cast the Nauglafring into the sea, whence it shall not return until the End; and she leapt herself into the waves, and took the form of a white sea-bird, and flew away lamenting and seeking for Eärendel about all the shores of the world.\nUpon the havens of Sirion new woe had fallen. The dwelling of Elwing there, where still she possessed the Nauglafring8 and the glorious Silmaril, became known unto the remaining sons of Fëanor, Maidros and Maglor and Damrod and Díriel; and they gathered together from their wandering hunting-paths, and messages of friendship and yet stern demand they sent unto Sirion. But Elwing and the folk of Sirion would not yield that jewel which Beren had won and Lúthien had worn, and for which Dior the Fair was slain; and least of all while Eärendel their lord was in the sea, for them seemed that in that jewel lay the gift of bliss and healing that had come upon their houses and their ships.\nAnd so came in the end to pass the last and cruellest of the slayings of Elf by Elf; and that was the third of the great wrongs achieved by the accursed oath. For the sons of Fëanor came down upon the exiles of Gondolin and the remnant of Doriath and destroyed them. Though some of their folk stood aside, and some few rebelled and were slain upon the other part aiding Elwing against their own lords (for such was the sorrow and confusion of the hearts of Elfinesse in those days), yet Maidros and Maglor won the day. Alone they now remained of the sons of Fëanor, for in that battle Damrod and Díriel were slain; but the folk of Sirion perished or fled away, or departed of need to join the people of Maidros, who claimed now the lordship of all the Elves of the Outer Lands. And yet Maidros gained not the Silmaril, for Elwing seeing that all was lost and her child Elrond 9 taken captive, eluded the host of Maidros, and with the Nauglafring upon her breast she cast herself into the sea, and perished as folk thought.\nEärendel was their guide; but the Gods would not suffer him to return again, and he built him a white tower upon the confines of the outer world in the Northern regions of the Sundering Seas; and there all the sea-birds of the earth at times repaired. And often was Elwing in the form and likeness of a bird; and she devised wings for the ship of Eärendel, and it was lifted even into the oceans of the air. Marvellous and magical was that ship, a starlit flower in the sky, bearing a wavering and holy flame; and the folk of earth beheld it from afar and wondered, and looked up from despair, saying surely a Silmaril is in the sky, a new star is risen in the West. Maidros said unto Maglor :20 ‘If that be the Silmaril that riseth by some power divine out of the sea into which we saw it fall, then let us be glad, that its glory is seen now by many.’ Thus hope arose and a promise of betterment; but Morgoth was filled with doubt.\n10 This passage was rewritten thus: But great was the sorrow of Eärendel and Elwing for the ruin of the havens of Sirion, and the captivity of their sons; and they feared that they would be slain. But it was not so. For Maglor took pity on Elros and Elrond , and he cherished them, and love grew after between them, as little might be thought; but Maglor ’s heart was sick and weary, \u0026amp;c.\nThis passage, from the beginning of the paragraph, was extensively rewritten: In those days the ship of Eärendel was drawn by the Gods beyond the edge of the world, and it was lifted even into the oceans of the air. Marvellous and magical was that ship, a starlit flower in the sky, bearing a wavering and holy flame; and the folk of Earth beheld it from afar and wondered, and looked up from despair, saying surely a Silmaril is in the sky, a new star is risen in the West. But Elwing mourned for Eärendel yet found him never again, and they are sundered till the world endeth. Therefore she built a white tower upon the confines of the outer world in the Northern regions of the Sundering Seas; and there all the seabirds of the earth at times repaired. And Elwing devised wings for herself, and desired to fly to Eärendel’s ship. But [?she fell back]\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; But when the flame of it appeared on high Maglor said unto Maidros:\nBut Maidros would not obey the call, preparing to fulfil even yet the obligation of his oath, though with weary loathing and despair. For he would have given battle for the Silmarils, if they were withheld from him, though he should stand alone in all the world save for Maglor his brother alone. And he sent unto Fionwë and bade him yield up those jewels which of old Morgoth stole from Fëanor. But Fionwë said that the right that Fëanor and his sons had in that which they had made, had perished, because of the many and evil deeds they had wrought blinded by their oath, and most of all the slaying of Dior and the assault upon Elwing. To Valinor must Maidros and Maglor return and abide the judgement of the Gods, by whose decree alone would he yield the jewels to any keeping other than his own.\nMaidros was minded to submit, for he was sad at heart, and he said: ‘The oath decrees not that we shall not bide our time, and maybe in Valinor all shall be forgiven and forgot, and we shall be vouchsafed our own.’ But Maglor said that if once they returned and the favour of the Gods was not granted them, then would their oath still remain, and be fulfilled in despair yet greater; ‘and who can tell to what dreadful end we shall come if we disobey the Powers in their own land, or purpose ever to bring war into their Guarded Realm again?’ And so came it that Maidros and Maglor crept into the camps of Fionwë, and laid hands on the Silmarils; and they took to their weapons when they were discovered. But the sons of the Valar arose in wrath and prevented them, and took Maidros prisoner; and yet Maglor eluded them and escaped.\nIt is told too of Maglor that he fled far, but he too could not endure the pain with which the Silmaril tormented him; and in an agony he cast it from him into a yawning gap filled with fire, in the rending of the Western lands, and the jewel vanished into the bosom of the Earth. But Maglor came never back among the folk of Elfinesse, but wandered singing in pain and in regret beside the sea.\nBut Fionwë marched through the Western lands summoning the remnants of the Gnomes, and the Dark-elves that had yet not looked on Valinor, to join with the thralls released and to depart. But Maidros would not harken, and he prepared, though with weary loathing and despair, to perform even yet the obligation of his oath. For Maidros and Maglor would have given battle for the Silmarils, were they withheld, even against the victorious host of Valinor, and though they stood alone in all the world. And they sent unto Fionwë and bade him yield now up those jewels which of old Morgoth stole from Fëanor. But Fionwë said that the right to the work of their hands which Fëanor and his sons had formerly possessed now had perished, because of their many and evil deeds blinded by their oath, and most of all the slaying of Dior and the assault upon Elwing; the light of the Silmarils should go now to the Gods whence it came, and to Valinor must Maidros and Maglor return and there abide the judgement of the Gods, by whose decree alone would Fionwë yield the jewels from his charge. Maglor was minded to submit, for he was sad at heart, and he said: ‘The oath says not that we may not bide our time, and maybe in Valinor all shall be forgiven and forgot, and we shall come into our own.’ But Maidros said that if once they returned and the favour of the Gods were withheld from them, then would their oath still remain, to be fulfilled in despair yet greater; ‘and who can tell to what dreadful doom we shall come, if we disobey the Powers in their own land, or purpose ever to bring war again into their Guarded Realm?’ And so it came that Maidros and Maglor crept into the camps of Fionwë, and laid hands on the Silmarils, and slew the guards; and there they prepared to defend themselves to the death. But Fionwë stayed his folk; and the brethren departed and fled far away.\nEach took a single Silmaril, saying that one was lost unto them and two remained, and but two brethren. But the jewel burned the hand of Maidros in pain unbearable (and he had but one hand as has before been told); and he perceived that it was as Fionwë had said, and that his right thereto had become void, and that the oath was vain. And being in anguish and despair he cast himself into a gaping chasm filled with fire, and so ended; and his Silmaril was taken into the bosom of the Earth. And it is told also of Maglor that he could not bear the pain with which the Silmaril tormented him; and he cast it at last into the sea, and thereafter wandered ever upon the shore singing in pain and regret beside the waves; for Maglor was the mightiest of the singers of old, but he came never back among the folk of Elfinesse.\nYet not all would forsake the Outer Lands where they had long suffered and long dwelt; and some lingered many an age in the West and North, and especially in the western isles and the lands of Leithien. And among these were Maglor as has been told; and with him Elrond the Half-elfin,8 who after went among mortal Men again, and from whom alone the blood of the elder race9 and the seed divine of Valinor have come among Mankind (for he was son of Elwing, daughter of Dior, son of Lúthien, child of Thingol and Melian; and Eärendel his sire was son of Idril Celebrindal, the fair maid of Gondolin). But ever as the ages drew on and the Elf-folk faded on the Earth, they would still set sail at eve from our Western shores; as still they do, when now there linger few anywhere of their lonely companies.\nBut there are also many changes of a less structural character in Q II, as: Eärendel’s earlier voyages about the shores of the Outer Lands before he built Wingelot; his warning dreams to return in haste to the Mouths of Sirion, which in the event he never came back to, being intercepted by the coming of Elwing as a seabird and her tidings of what had happened there in his absence – hence the disappearance of Bronweg from the story; the healing power of the Silmaril on the people of Sirion (see p. 190); the great light of the Silmaril as Wingelot approached Valinor, and the suggestion that it was the power of the jewel that brought the ship through the enchantments and the shadows; Eärendel’s refusal to allow any of those that travelled with him to come with him into Valinor; the new explanation of the desertion of Tûn upon Kôr (for the story still endured that the city of the Elves was empty of its inhabitants when Eärendel came there); the greeting of Eärendel by Fionwë (now again the son of Manwë) as the Morning and Evening Star; the manning by the Teleri of the ships that bore the hosts of the West; and the sighting of the Silmaril in the sky by Maidros and Maglor and the people of the Outer Lands.\nBy subsequent emendation to Q II some further elements enter. To Tuor is ascribed a fate (note 3) hardly less astonishing than that of his cousin Túrin Turambar. Elrond ’s brother Elros appears (notes 4 and 9); and Maglor takes over Maidros’ rôle as their saviour, and as the less ruthless and single-minded of the two brothers (note 10; see the commentary on §18). The addition in note 19 stating that the leader of the Gnomes who had never departed from Valinor was Ingwiel son of Ingwë is at first sight surprising: one would expect Finrod (\u0026gt; Finarfin), as in The Silmarillion (p. 251). I think however that this addition was imperfectly accommodated to the text: the meaning intended was that Ingwiel was the chief of the Quendi (the Light-elves, the Vanyar) among whom the Gnomes of Valinor marched. † In a revision to Q§2 (note 6) the original text, saying that Ingwë never came back into the Outer Lands ‘until these tales were near their end’, was changed to a statement that he never returned. Ingwiel replaces Ingil son of Inwë of the Lost Tales, who built Ingil’s Tower in Tol Eressëa (I. 16) after his return from the Great Lands.\nThe story of the fate of the Silmarils in Q I advances on S, and here reaches an interesting transitional stage between S and Q II, where the final resolution is achieved. Maidros remains as in S the less fiercely resolute of the two surviving sons of Fëanor in the fulfilment of the oath: in S it is Maglor alone who steals a Silmaril from Fionwë’s keeping, and in Q I it is Maidros who is ‘minded to submit’, but is argued down by Maglor . In Q II the arguments remain, but the parts of Maidros and Maglor are reversed, just as in §17 (by later emendation to Q II, note 10) Maglor becomes the one who saved Elrond and Elros. In Q I both brothers go to steal the Silmarils from Fionwë, as in the final version of the legend; but, as in S, only Maglor carries his away – for in the new story Maidros is captured. Yet, whereas as in S only one of the two remaining Silmarils is consigned to the deep places by the act of one of the brothers ( Maglor ), and the other is retained by Fionwë and ultimately becomes Eärendel’s star – Maidros playing, so far as can be seen, no further part in its fate – in Q I the burning of the unrighteous hand, and the realisation that the right of the sons of Fëanor to the Silmarils is now void, becomes that of Maidros; and, a prisoner of Fionwë, he slays himself, casting the Silmaril on the ground (and though the text of Q I does not go so far as this, the logic of the narrative must lead to the giving of this Silmaril to Eärendel, as in S). The emended version in S (notes 6 and 7), that Maglor casts his Silmaril into a fiery pit and thereafter wanders singing in sorrow by the sea (rather than that he casts himself also into the pit), is taken up into Q I.\nIn Q II the story has shifted again, to the final harmonious and symmetrical structure: the Silmaril of Beren is not lost, and becomes the star of Eärendel: both Maglor and Maidros take a Silmaril from the camp of Fionwë, and both cast them down into inaccessible places. Maidros still takes his own life, but does so by casting himself into the fiery pit – and this is a return to the original story of Maglor told in S. Maglor now casts his Silmaril into the sea – and thus the Silmarils of earth, sea, and sky are retained, but they are different Silmarils; for in the earlier versions it was one of those from the Iron Crown of Morgoth that became the Evening Star.\nDægmund Swinsere [I cannot explain Dægmund for Maglor . O.E. mund is ‘hand’, also ‘protection’; swinsere (not recorded) ‘musician, singer’ (cf. swinsian ‘make music’).] In the version of ‘The Silmarillion’ just referred to it is also said that ‘beyond the River Gelion the land narrowed suddenly, for the Great Sea ran into a mighty gulf reaching almost to the feet of Eredlindon, and there was a strait of mountainous land between the gulf and the inland sea of Helcar, by which one might come into the vast regions of the south of Middle-earth’. Again, these features are clearly seen on map V, where the ‘strait of mountainous land’ is called the ‘Straits of the World’. The enclosed areas to the east of Eredwethrin and south-east of Thangorodrim clearly represent the Encircling Mountains about Gondolin and the highlands of Taur-na-Fuin; we see what was later called the Gap of Maglor between those highlands and the Blue Mountains, and the rivers Gelion (with its tributaries, the rivers of Ossiriand), Sirion, and Narog. † With this part of map V compare the first ‘Silmarillion’ map and its Eastward extension.\nHere Damrod and Díriel ravaged Sirion, and were slain. Maidros and Maglor gave reluctant aid. Sirion’s folk were slain or taken into the company of Maidros. Elrond was taken to nurture by Maglor . Elwing cast herself with the Silmaril into the sea, but by Ulmo’s aid in the shape of a bird flew to Eärendel and found him returning.\nMaglor , Maidros, and Elrond with few free Elves, the last of the Gnomes, live65 in hiding from Morgoth, who rules all Beleriand and the North, and thrusts ever East and South.\nFionwë departed to Valinor with the Light-elves and many of the Gnomes and the other Elves of the Hither Lands, but Elrond Half-elfin remained and ruled in the West of the world. Maidros and Maglor perished in70 a last endeavour to seize the Silmarils which Fionwë took from Morgoth’s crown.71 So ended the First Age of the World and Beleriand was no more.\n71 Later addition: but Maidros perished and his Silmaril went into the bosom of the earth, and Maglor cast his into the sea, and wandered for ever on the shores of the world.\nIn a few points AB differs from the later story. Here, Turgon’s host descended out of Taur-na-Fuin, whereas in Q (as rewritten, note 7) ‘they encamped before the West Pass in sight of the walls of Hithlum’, just as in The Silmarillion (p. 192) the host of Gondolin ‘had been stationed southward guarding the Pass of Sirion’. The loyalty of Bór and his sons, not mentioned in Q, now appears, but whereas in the later story Maglor slew Uldor, and the sons of Bór slew Ulfast and Ulwarth ‘ere they themselves were slain’, in AB Cranthir slew Uldor, and Ulfast and Ulwar slew Bór and his three sons. The number of a thousand Balrogs who came from Angband when ‘Hell was emptied’ shows once again (see II. 212–13 and p. 173), and more clearly than ever, that Morgoth’s demons of fire were not conceived as rare or peculiarly terrible – unlike the Dragon.\nAnnals 208 to 233 In annal 210 it is said that Maidros actually forswore his oath (although in the final annal he still strives to fulfil it); and this is clearly to be related to his revulsion at the killing of Dior’s sons in the annal for 206. Damrod and Díriel now emerge as the most ferocious of the surviving sons of Fëanor, and it is on them that the blame for the assault on the people of Sirion is primarily laid: Maidros and Maglor only ‘gave reluctant aid’. This develops further an increasing emphasis in these texts on the weariness and loathing felt by Maidros and Maglor for the duty they felt bound to.\nIn annal 229 Maglor , rather than Maidros as in Q §17, becomes the saviour of Elrond ; this change is made also in a late rewriting of Q 11 (§17 note 10), where however Elrond ’s brother Elros also emerges, as is not the case in AB.\nThe statement (subsequently corrected, notes 70–1) that both Maglor and Maidros ‘perished in a last endeavour to seize the Silmarils’ seems to suggest a passing movement to yet another formulation of the story (see the table on p. 202); but may well have been a slip due to hasty composition and compression.\nAnd King Felagund had his seat at Nargothrond far to the South, but his fort and strong place was in the North, in the pass into Beleriand between Eredwethion and Taur-na-Danion, and it was upon an isle in the waters of Sirion, that was called Tolsirion. South of Taur-na-Danion was a wide space untenanted between the fences of Melian and the regions of Finrod’s sons, who held most to the northern borders of the wooded mountains. Easternmost dwelt Orodreth, nighest to his friends the sons of Fëanor. And of these Celegorm and Curufin held the land between Aros and Celon even from the borders of Doriath to the Pass of Aglon between Taur-na-Danion and the Hill of Himling, and this pass and the plains beyond they guarded. But Maidros had a strong place upon the Hill of Himling, and the lower hills that lie from the Forest even to Eredlindon were called the Marches of Maidros, and he was much in the plains to the North, but held also the woods south between Celon and Gelion; and to the East Maglor held the land even as far as Eredlindon; but Cranthir ranged in the wide lands between Gelion and the Blue Mountains; and all East Beleriand behind was wild and little tenanted save by scattered Dark-elves, but it was under the overlordship of Maidros from Sirion’s mouths to Gelion (where it joins with Brilthor), and Damrod and Díriel were there, and came not much to war in the North. But Ossiriand was not subject to Maidros or his brethren, and there dwelt the Green-elves between Gelion and Ascar and Adurant, and the mountains. Into East Beleriand many of the Elf-lords even from afar came at times for hunting in the wild woods.\nThe territories of the other sons of Fëanor are also given clearer bounds, with mention for the first time of the Marches of Maidros, of Maglor ’s land in the East ‘even as far as Eredlindon’ (afterwards ‘ Maglor ’s Gap’), of Cranthir’s (not yet called Thargelion) between Gelion and the mountains, and of the territory of Damrod and Díriel in the South of East Beleriand. I do not know why Maidros’ overlordship is said to extend from Sirion’s mouths to Gelion ‘where it joins with Brilthor’. At this time Brilthor was the fifth (not as later the fourth) of the tributaries of Gelion coming down from the mountains, the sixth and most southerly being Adurant (pp. 230–1).\nThe Lost Road and Other Writings Here the Dispossessed came into the North, and Fëanor led them, and with him came his seven sons, Maidros, Maglor , Celegorm,2 Curufin, Cranthir, Damrod, and Díriel, and with them their friends, the younger sons of Finrod. They burned the Telerian ships upon the coast, where it is since called Losgar, nigh to the outlet of Drengist. Soon after they fought that battle with the host of Morgoth that is named Dagor-os-Giliath;3 and Fëanor had the victory, but he was mortally wounded by Gothmog, and died in Mithrim.\nThe sons of Finrod held the land from Eredwethion unto the eastern end of the Taur-na-Danion,9 the Forest of Pines, from the northward slopes of which they also held watch over Bladorion. Here were Angrod and Egnor, and Orodreth was nighest to the sons of Fëanor in the East.10 Of these Celegorm and Curufin held the land between the rivers Aros and Celon, from the borders of Doriath to the pass of Aglon, that is between Taur-na-Danion and the Hill of Himling;11 and this pass and the plain beyond they guarded. Maidros had his stronghold upon Himling, and those lower hills that lie from the Forest of Pines unto the foothills of Eredlindon were called the Marches of Maidros. Thence he rode often into East Bladorion, the plains to the north, but he held also the woods south between Celon and Gelion. Maglor lay to the east again about the upper waters of Gelion, where the hills are low or fail; and Cranthir ranged beneath the shadows of the Blue Mountains. And all the folk of Fëanor kept watch by scout and outrider towards the North-east.\nThe sons of Fëanor were not slain, but Celegorm and Curufin were defeated, and fled unto Orodreth in the west of Taur-na-Danion.25 Maidros did deeds of valour, and Morgoth could not as yet take the heights of Himling, but he broke through the passes26 to the east and ravaged far into East Beleriand, and the Gnomes of Fëanor’s house, for the most part, fled before him. Maglor joined Maidros, but Cranthir, Damrod, and Díriel fled into the South.\n[463] Here the Swarthy Men first came into Beleriand in the East. They were short and broad, long and strong in the arm, growing much hair on face and breast, and their locks were dark, as were their eyes; their skins were swart, yet their countenances were not uncomely for the most part, though some were grim-looking and illfavoured. Their houses were many, and some had liking rather for the Dwarves of the mountains, of Nogrod and Belegost, than for the Elves. But Maidros seeing the weakness of the Noldor, and the growing power of the armies of Morgoth, made alliance with these Men, and with their chieftains Bor and Ulfand.33 The sons of Bor were Borlas and Boromir and Borthandos, and they followed Maidros and Maglor and were faithful. The sons of Ulfand the Swart were Uldor the Accursed, and Ulfast, and Ulwar,34 and they followed Cranthir the Dark and swore allegiance to him, and proved faithless.\n329 [529] Here Damrod and Díriel ravaged Sirion, and were slain. Maidros and Maglor were there, but they were sick at heart. This was the third kinslaying. The folk of Sirion were taken into the people of Maidros, such as yet remained; and Elrond was taken to nurture by Maglor . But Elwing cast herself with the Silmaril into the sea, and Ulmo bore her up, and in the shape of a bird she flew seeking Eärendel, and found him returning.\n340 [540] Maidros and Maglor , sons of Fëanor, dwelt in hiding in the south of Eastern Beleriand, about Amon Ereb, the Lonely Hill, that stands solitary amid the wide plain. But Morgoth sent against them, and they fled to the Isle of Balar. Now Morgoth’s triumph was complete, and all that land was in his hold, and none were left there, Elves or Men, save such as were his thralls.\nNow the Silmarils were regained, for one was borne in the airs by Eärendel, and the other two Fionwë took from the crown of Melko; and he beat the crown into fetters for his feet. Maidros and Maglor driven by their oath seized now the two Silmarils and fled; but Maidros perished, and the Silmaril that he took went into the bosom of the earth, and Maglor cast his into the sea, and wandered ever after upon the shores of the world in sorrow.\nIn the third paragraph of this annal is a clear reference to ‘ Maglor ’s Gap’ (unnamed). The region where ‘the hills are low or fail’, shown clearly on the Second Map (though the name was never written in), is implied by the lines on the Eastward Extension of the First Map (IV. 231).\nAnnal 263 AB 1 does not name the sons of Bor, nor state that they followed Maidros and Maglor . Bor’s son Boromir is the first bearer of this name. Afterwards the Boromir of the Elder Days was the father of Bregor father of Bregolas and Barahir.\nAnnal 340 It is not told in AB 1 that Maidros and Maglor and their people fled in the end from Amon Ereb to the Isle of Balar. In Q nothing is told of the actual habitation of Maidros and Maglor during the final years.\n§41 The Noldor afterwards came back to the Middle-earth, and this tale tells mostly of their deeds; therefore the names and kinship of their princes may here be told, in that form which these names after had in the tongue of the Gnomes as it was in Beleriand upon the Middle-earth. Finwë was King of the Noldor. His sons were Fëanor, Fingolfin, and Finrod. Of these Fëanor was the mightiest in skill of word and of hand, more learned in lore than his brethren; in his heart his spirit burned as flame. Fingolfin was the strongest, the most steadfast, and the most valiant. Finrod was the fairest, and the most wise of heart. The seven sons of Fëanor were Maidros the tall; Maglor a musician and a mighty singer, whose voice carried far over land and sea; Celegorn the fair, and Cranthir the dark; and Curufin the crafty, who inherited most of his father’s skill of hand; and the youngest Damrod and Díriel, who were twin brethren alike in mood and face. They afterwards were great hunters in the woods of the Middle-earth. A hunter also was Celegorn, who in Valinor was a friend of Oromë and followed oft the great god’s horn.\n§90 Then the six brethren of Maidros drew back and fortified a great camp in Hithlum; but Morgoth held Maidros as hostage, and sent word to Maglor that he would only release his brother if the Noldor would forsake their war, returning either to Valinor, or else departing from Beleriand and marching to the South of the world. But the Gnomes could not return to Valinor, having burned the ships, and they did not believe that Morgoth would release Maidros if they departed; and they were unwilling to depart, whatever he might do. Therefore Morgoth hung Maidros from the face of a precipice upon Thangorodrim, and he was caught to the rock by the wrist of his right hand in a band of steel.\n§102 And even while Turgon and Felagund were wandering abroad, Morgoth seeing that many Gnomes were dispersed over the land made trial of their strength and watchfulness. He shook the North with sudden earthquake, and fire came from the Iron Mountains; and the Orcs poured forth across the plain of Bladorion, and invaded Beleriand through the pass of Sirion in the West, and burst through the land of Maglor in the East; for there is a gap in that region between the hills of Maidros and the outliers of the Blue Mountains. But Fingolfin and Maidros gathered great force, and while others sought out and destroyed all the Orcs that strayed in Beleriand and did great evil, they came upon the main host from the other side, even as it was assaulting Dorthonion, and they defeated the servants of Morgoth, and pursued the remnant across Bladorion, and destroyed them utterly within sight of Angband’s gates. This was the second great battle of these wars and was named Dagor Aglareb, the Glorious Battle; and for a long while after none of the servants of Morgoth would venture from his gates; for they feared the kings of the Gnomes. And many reckoned from that day the peace of the Siege of Angband. For the chieftains took warning from that assault and drew their leaguer closer, and set such watch upon Angband that Fingolfin boasted Morgoth could never again escape nor come upon them unawares.\nOn the date of Turgon’s actual departure to Gondolin see the note on chronology at the end of this commentary. §102 QS adds to the account of the Dagor Aglareb in AB 2, annal 51: the Orc-hosts came through the Pass of Sirion and through Maglor ’s Gap (see the commentary on AB 2 annal 52), and Fingolfin and Maidros defeated the main host as it was assaulting Dorthonion. Here and subsequently the form first written was Dorthanion, but the change to Dorthonion was made early. For the many forms preceding Dorthonion see note 9 to AB 2.\n§114 And east of this wild land lay the country of Ossiriand, between Gelion and Eredlindon. Gelion was a great river, and it arose in two sources, and had at first two branches: Little Gelion that came from the hill of Himring, and Greater Gelion that came from Mount Rerir, an outlier of Eredlindon; and between these branches was the land of Maglor , son of Fëanor. Then joining his two arms Gelion flowed south, a swift river but of small volume, until he found his tributaries some forty leagues south of the meeting of his arms. Ere he found the sea Gelion was twice as long as Sirion, but ever less wide and full; for more rain fell in Hithlum and Dorthonion, whence Sirion drew his waters, than in the East. From Eredlindon flowed the tributaries of Gelion. These were six: Ascar (that was after renamed Rathlóriel), Thalos, Legolin, Brilthor, Duilwen, and Adurant; they were swift and turbulent, falling steeply from the mountains, but going southward each was longer than the one before, since Gelion bent ever away from Eredlindon. Between Ascar in the North and Adurant in the South, and between Gelion and the mountains, lay Ossiriand, the Land of Seven Rivers, filled with green woods wide and fair.\n§118 But east of Dorthonion the marches of Beleriand were more open to attack, and only hills of no great height guarded the vale of Gelion from the North. Therefore the sons of Fëanor with many folk, well nigh half of the people of the Gnomes, dwelt in that region, upon the Marches of Maidros, and in the lands behind; and the riders of the folk of Fëanor rode often upon the vast northern plain, Lothland the wide and empty, east of Bladorion, lest Morgoth attempted any sortie towards East Beleriand. And the chief citadel of Maidros was upon the hill of Himring, the Ever-cold; and this was wide-shouldered, bare of trees, and flat upon the summit, and surrounded by many lesser hills. Its name it bore because there was a pass, exceeding steep upon the west, between it and Dorthonion, and this was the pass of Aglon, and was a gate unto Doriath, and a bitter wind blew ever through it from the North. But Celegorn and Curufin fortified Aglon, and manned it with great strength, and they held all the land southward between the river Aros that arose in Dorthonion and his tributary Celon that came from Himring. And between Celon and Little Gelion was the ward of Damrod and Díriel. And between the arms of Gelion was the ward of Maglor , and here in one place the hills failed altogether; and here it was that the Orcs came into East Beleriand before the Second Battle. Therefore the Gnomes held much cavalry in the plains at that place; and the people of Cranthir fortified the mountains to the east of Maglor ’s Gap. For Mount Rerir, and about it many lesser heights, stood out from the main range of Eredlindon westward; and in the angle between Rerir and Eredlindon there was a lake, shadowed by mountains on all sides save the south. This was Lake Helevorn, deep and dark, and beside it Cranthir had his abode; but all the great land between Gelion and Eredlindon, and between Rerir and the river Ascar, was called by the Gnomes Thargelion (that is the land beyond Gelion), or Dor Granthir the land of Cranthir; and it was here that the Gnomes first met the Dwarves.*\n§142 But they overwhelmed the riders of the folk of Fëanor upon Lothland, for Glómund came thither, and passed through Maglor ’s Gap, and destroyed all the land between the arms of Gelion. And the Orcs took the fortress upon the west slopes of Mount Rerir, and ravaged all Thargelion, the land of Cranthir; and they defiled Lake Helevorn. Thence they passed over Gelion with fire and terror and came far into East Beleriand. Maglor joined Maidros upon Himring; but Cranthir fled and joined the remnant of his people to the scattered folk of the hunters, Damrod and Díriel, and they retreated and passed Rhamdal in the South. Upon Amon Ereb they maintained a watch and some strength of war, and they had aid of the Green-elves; and the Orcs came not yet into Ossiriand or the wild of South Beleriand.\n§151 Now the Easterlings or Rómenildi, as the Elves named these newcomers, were short and broad, long and strong in the arm; their hair was black, and grew much also upon their face and breast; their skins were swart or sallow, and their eyes brown; yet their countenances were for the most part not uncomely, though some were grim and fierce. Their houses and tribes were many, and some had greater liking for the Dwarfs of the mountains than for the Elves. But the sons of Fëanor, seeing the weakness of the Noldor, and the growing power of the armies of Morgoth, made alliances with these men, and gave their friendship to the greatest of their chieftains, Bór and Ulfang. And Morgoth was well content; for this was as he had designed. The sons of Bór were Borlas and Boromir and Borthandos; and they followed Maidros and Maglor , and cheated the hope of Morgoth, and were faithful. The sons of Ulfang the Black were Ulfast and Ulwarth and Uldor the Accursed; and they followed Cranthir and swore allegiance to him, and proved faithless.\n§15 The number of a thousand Balrogs (found in both versions of the Annals) was still present (see the commentary on §89). – After ‘all perished in that battle’ the earlier text (C) has the addition ‘defending Maglor against the assault of Uldor’, but this was not taken up in D. It is not said in the Annals that Ulfast and Ulwar(th) were slain by the sons of Bór (‘ere they themselves fell’), but the reverse.\n§13 Now when first Vingelot was set to sail on the seas of heaven, it rose unlooked-for, glittering and bright; and the folk of earth beheld it from afar and wondered, and they took it for a sign of hope. And when this new star arose in the West, Maidros said unto Maglor : ‘Surely that is a Silmaril that shineth in the sky?’ And Maglor said: ‘If it be verily that Silmaril that we saw cast into the sea that riseth again by the power of the Gods, then let us be glad; for its glory is seen now by many, and is yet secure from all evil.’ Then the Elves looked up, and despaired no longer; but Morgoth was filled with doubt.\n§21 But Fionwë said that the right to the work of their hands, which Fëanor and his sons formerly possessed, had now perished, because of their many and merciless deeds, being blinded by their oath, and most of all because of the slaying of Dior and the assault upon Elwing. The light of the Silmarils should go now to the Gods, whence it came in the beginning; and to Valinor must Maidros and Maglor return and there abide the judgement of the Valar, by whose decree alone would Fionwë yield the jewels from his charge.\n§22 Maglor desired indeed to submit, for his heart was sorrowful, and he said: ‘The oath says not that we may not bide our time, and maybe in Valinor all shall be forgiven and forgot, and we shall come into our own in peace.’ But Maidros said that, if once they returned and the favour of the Gods were withheld from them, then their oath would still remain, but its fulfilment be beyond all hope. ‘And who can tell to what dreadful doom we shall come, if we disobey the Powers in their own land, or purpose ever to bring war again into their holy realm?’ And Maglor said: ‘Yet if Manwë and Varda themselves deny the fulfilment of an oath to which we named them in witness, is it not made void?’ And Maidros answered: ‘But how shall our voices reach to Ilúvatar beyond the circles of the World? And by Him we swore in our madness, and called the Everlasting Darkness upon us, if we kept not our word. Who shall release us?’ ‘If none can release us,’ said Maglor , ‘then indeed the Everlasting Darkness shall be our lot, whether we keep our oath or break it; but less evil shall we do in the breaking.’ Yet he yielded to the will of Maidros, and they took counsel together how they should lay hands on the Silmarils.\n§25 And it is told of Maglor that he could not endure the pain with which the Silmaril tormented him; and he cast it at last into the sea, and thereafter he wandered ever upon the shores singing in pain and regret beside the waves. For Maglor was the mightiest of the singers of old, but he came never back among the people of the Elves. And thus it came to pass that the Silmarils found their long homes: one in the airs of heaven, and one in the fires of the heart of the world,\nand one in the deep waters.\n§28 Yet not all the Eldalië were willing to forsake the Hither Lands where they had long suffered and long dwelt; and some lingered many an age in the West and North, and especially in the western isles and in the Land of Leithien. And among these were Maglor , as hath been told; and with him for a while was Elrond Halfelven, who chose, as was granted to him, to be among the Elf-kindred; but Elros his brother chose to abide with Men. And from these brethren alone the blood of the Firstborn and the seed divine of Valinor have come among Mankind: for they were the sons of Elwing, Dior’s daughter, Lúthien’s son, child of Thingol and Melian; and Eärendel their sire was Idril’s son Celebrindal, the fair maid of Gondolin. But ever as the ages drew on and the Elf-folk faded upon earth, they would set sail at eve from the western shores of this world, as still they do, until now there linger few anywhere of their lonely companies.\n§22 The debate between Maglor and Maidros is articulated further than it was in Q, with the last and wisest word to Maglor , though the outcome is the same: for Maidros overbore him.\nMAK- sword, or as verb-stem: fight (with sword), cleave. *makla: Q makil sword; N magl, magol. *maktā: Q mahta- wield a weapon (blended with maȝ-tā, see MAȜ), fight: hence mahtar warrior = N maethor. N maeth battle, fight (not of general host but of two or a few), maetha to fight. Cf. Maglaðûr [cf. D0Ȝ?] or Maglaðhonn = Black-sword (as name). Q Makalaure = Gold-cleaver, name of fifth son of Feanor, N Maglor .\nMorgoth\u0026rsquo;s Ring Thus spoke Maidros and Maglor , and Celegorn, Curufin and Cranthir, Damrod and Díriel, princes of the Noldor. But by that name none should swear an oath, good or evil, nor in anger call upon such witness, and many quailed to hear the fell words. For so sworn, good or evil, an oath may not be broken, and it shall pursue oathkeeper or oathbreaker to the world’s end.\n§150 Thus at last the Teleri were overcome, and a great part of their mariners that dwelt in Alqualondë were wickedly slain. For the Noldor were become fierce and desperate, and the Teleri had less strength, and were armed mostly with light bows only. Then the Noldor drew away their white ships, and manned their oars as best they might, and rowed them north along the coast. And Olwë called upon Ossë, but he came not; for he had been summoned to Valmar to the vigil and council of the gods; and it was not permitted by the Valar that the Flight of the Noldor should be hindered by force. But Uinen wept for the mariners of the Teleri; and the sea rose in wrath against the slayers, so that many of the ships were wrecked and those in them drowned. Of the Kin-slaying at Alqualondë more is told in that lament which is named Noldolantë,16 The Fall of the Noldor, which Maglor made ere he was lost.\n§150 On the weapons of the Teleri see p. 106, §97. — The song of the Flight of the Gnomes (QS §70) is now called Noldolantë, the Fall of the Noldor, ‘which Maglor made ere he was lost.’\n§41 The Noldor afterwards came back to Middle-earth, and this tale tells mostly of their deeds; therefore the names and kinship of their princes may here be told in that form which these names after had in the tongue of the Gnomes as it was [\u0026gt; the Elves] in Beleriand upon the Middle-earth. Finwë was king of the Noldor. His sons were Fëanor, Fingolfin, and Finrod [\u0026gt; Finarphin]. Of these Fëanor was the mightiest in skill of word and hand, more learned in lore than his brethren; in his heart his spirit burned as flame. Fingolfin was the strongest, the most steadfast, and the most valiant. Finrod [\u0026gt; Finarphin] was the fairest, and the most wise of heart; and afterwards he was a friend of the sons of Olwë, lord of the Teleri, and had to wife Eärwen, the swan-maiden of Alqualondë, Olwë’s daughter. The seven sons of Fëanor were Maidros [\u0026gt; Maedhros] the tall; Maglor a musician and a mighty singer, whose voice was heard far over land and sea; Celegorn [\u0026gt; Celegorm] the fair, and Cranthir [\u0026gt; Caranthir] the dark; and Curufin the crafty, who inherited most of his father’s skill of hand; and the youngest Damrod and Díriel [\u0026gt; Amrod and Amras], who were twin brothers alike in mood and face. They afterwards were great hunters in the woods of Middle-earth. A hunter also was Celegorn [\u0026gt; Celegorm], who in Valinor was a friend of Oromë and followed oft the great god’s horn.\n§41 The marriage of Finrod (= Finarphin) to Eärwen Olwë’s daughter is recorded under the Valian Year 1280 in AAm §85 (p. 93). — By a late change to LQ 2 Maglor \u0026gt; Maelor ; Maelor occurs in the later Lay of Leithian, III.353.\nThe War of the Jewels In this year Fingolfin, King of the Noldor, called a great council and made a high feast, that was long after remembered as Mereth Aderthad, the Feast of Reuniting. And it was held nigh the fair pools of Ivrin (whence the swift Narog arose), for there the lands were green and fair at the feet of the mountains that shielded them from the North. Thither came many of the chieftains and people of Fingolfin and Inglor; and of the sons of Fëanor Maidros and Maglor with warriors of the March; and there they were joined by Cirdan and many folk of the Havens, and great concourse of the Grey-elves from woods and fields far and near, and even from Ossiriand there came some of the Nandor on behalf of their folk. But Thingol came not himself from Doriath, and sent but two messengers, Dairon and Mablung, bringing his greetings. At Mereth Aderthad many counsels were taken in good will, and oaths were sworn of league and friendship, and there was much mirth and good hope; and indeed there followed after a fair time of peace, of growth and blossoming, and all the land was glad, though still the Shadow brooded in the North.\nHere Glaurung, the first of the Urulóki, the fire-drakes of the North, came forth from Angband’s gate by night. He was yet young and scarce half-grown (for long and slow is the life of those worms), but the Elves fled before him to Erydwethrin and to Dorthonion in dismay; and he defiled the fields of Ardgalen. Then Fingon, prince of Hithlum, rode against him with archers upon horseback, and hemmed him round with a ring of swift riders. And Glaurung in turn was dismayed, for he could not endure their darts, being not yet come to his full armoury; and he fled back to hell, and came not forth again for many years. But Morgoth was ill pleased that Glaurung had disclosed himself over soon; and after his defeat there was the long peace of wellnigh two hundred years. In that time there was naught but affrays on the north-marches, and all Beleriand prospered and grew rich, and the Noldor built many towers and fair dwellings and made many things of beauty, and many poesies and histories and books of lore. And in many parts of the land the Noldor and Sindar became welded into one folk and spoke the same tongue; though ever this difference remained between them, that the Noldor of purer race had the greater power of mind and body, being both the mightier warriors and sages, and they built with stone, and loved rather the hill-slopes and open lands. Whereas the Sindar had the fairer voices and were more skilled in music (save only Maglor son of Fëanor), and loved the woods and riversides, and some still would wander far and wide without settled abode, and they sang as they went.\nHere there was fighting on the north-marches, more bitter than there had been since the routing of Glaurung; for the Orcs attempted to pierce the pass of Aglon. There Maidros and Maglor were aided by the sons of Finrod, and Bëor was with them, the first of Men to draw sword in behalf of the Eldar. In this year Barahir son of Bëor was born, who after dwelt in Dorthonion.\n§148 Against the March of Maidros there came also a great army and the sons of Fëanor were overwhelmed. Maidros and Maglor held out valiantly upon the Hill of Himring, and Morgoth could not yet take the great fortress that they had there built; but the Orcs broke through upon either side, through Aglon and between Gelion and Celon, and they ravaged far into East Beleriand driving the Eldar before them, and Cranthir and Damrod and Díriel fled into the south. Celegorn and Curufin held strong forces behind Aglon, and many horsed archers, but they were overthrown, and Celegorn and Curufin hardly escaped, and passed westward along the north borders of Doriath with such mounted following as they could save, and came thus at length to the vale of Sirion.\n[Now the two chieftains] that had the greatest followings and authority were named Bor and Ulfang. The sons of Bor were Borlas and Boromir and Borthandos, and they were goodly men, and they followed Maidros and Maglor and were faithful. The sons of Ulfang the Swart were Ulfast and Ulwarth and Uldor the Accursed; and they followed Cranthir and swore allegiance to him, and were faithless. (It was after thought that the people of Ulfang were already secretly in the service of Morgoth ere they came to Beleriand.)*\nYet neither by wolf, balrog, nor dragon would Morgoth have achieved his end, but for the treachery of Men. In this hour the plots of Ulfang were revealed; for many of the Easterlings turned and fled, their hearts being filled with lies and fear; but the sons of Ulfang went over suddenly to the side of Morgoth and drove in upon the rear of the sons of Fëanor. And in the confusion that they wrought they came near to the standard of Maidros. They reaped not the reward that Morgoth promised them, for Maglor slew Uldor the Accursed, the leader in treason, and Bór and his sons slew Ulfast and Ulwarth ere they themselves were slain. But new strength of evil men came up that Uldor had summoned and kept hidden in the eastern hills, and the host of Maidros being assailed now on three sides, by the Orcs, and the beasts, and by the Swarthy Men, was dispersed and fled this way and that. Yet fate saved the sons of Fëanor, and though all were wounded, none were slain, for they drew together and gathering a remnant of Noldor and of the Naugrim about them they hewed a way out of the battle and escaped towards Mount Dolmed.\nIn AB 2 (V.126) and QS (§99) Mereth Aderthad was held in Nan Tathren, the Land of Willows. GA is more specific concerning those who were present than are the earlier texts: Maidros and Maglor ; Cirdan; and Dairon and Mablung as the only two representatives from Doriath (on Thingol’s aloofness see §47 and commentary).\nThe foresight of Felagund is undoubtedly intended to be a true foresight (like all such foresight, though it may be ambiguous). If full weight is given to the precise words used by Felagund, then it may be said that the conclusion of QS (V.331), where it is told that Maidros and Maglor did each regain a Silmaril for a brief time, is not contradicted.\nIn AB 2 and in QS (§15) it was Cranthir, not Maglor , who slew Uldor the Accursed. It is not said in those texts that ‘new strength of evil men came up that Uldor had summoned and kept hidden in the eastern hills’, nor, of course, that the Fëanorians, fleeing towards Mount Dolmed, took with them a remnant of the Naugrim, for it was only with the Grey Annals that the Dwarves took part in the battle (commentary on §212).\nNow it came to pass, when three hundred years and ten were gone since the Noldor came to Beleriand, in the days of the Long Peace, that Felagund journeyed east of Sirion and went hunting with Maglor and Maedros, sons of Fëanor. But he wearied of the chase and passed on alone towards the Mountains of Ered-lindon that he saw shining afar; and taking the Dwarf-road he crossed Gelion at the ford of Sarn-athrad, and turning south over the upper streams of Ascar, he came into the north of Ossiriand.\n‘But Maidros would not harken, and he prepared … to attempt in despair the fulfilment of his oath’ \u0026gt; ‘But Maidros and Maglor would not harken …’, with change of ‘he’ to ‘they’ and ‘his’ to ‘their’.\nMaidros and Maglor , last surviving sons of Fëanor, seize the Silmarils. Maidros perishes. The Silmarils are lost in fire and sea.\nTorment fell upon Maidros and his brethren ( Maglor , Damrod and Diriel) because of their unfulfilled oath.\nThe Peoples of Middle-Earth The second note reads: Maedros the eldest appears to have been unwedded, also the two youngest (twins, of whom one was by evil mischance burned with the ships); Celegorm also, since he plotted to take Lúthien as his wife. But Curufin, dearest to his father and chief inheritor of his father’s skills, was wedded, and had a son who came with him into exile, though his wife (unnamed) did not. Others who were wedded were Maelor , Caranthir. On the form Maelor for Maglor see X.182, §41. The reference in the first of these notes to the wife of Finrod Felagund is notable, since long before, in the Grey Annals, the story had emerged that Felagund had no wife, and that ‘she whom he had loved was Amárië of the Vanyar, and she was not permitted to go with him into exile’. That story had in fact been abandoned, or forgotten, but it would return: see the note on Gil-galad, p. 350.\n[ Maglor ] Kanafinwë ‘strong-voiced or ?commanding’. (Káno)58\nHis sons were too occupied in war and feuds to pay attention to such matters, save Maglor who was a poet, and Curufin, his fourth and favourite son to whom he gave his own name; but Curufin was most interested in the alien language of the Dwarves, being the only one of the Ñoldor to win their friendship. It was from him that the loremasters obtained such knowledge as they could of the Khuzdûl.\nThe Nature of Middle-Earth fn3 The most notable were those Maiar who took the form of the mighty speaking eagles that we hear of in the legends of the war of the Ñoldor against Melkor, and who remained in the West of Middle-earth until the fall of Sauron and the Dominion of Men, after which they are not heard of again. Their intervention in the story of Maelor , in the duel of Fingolfin and Melkor, in the rescue of Beren and Lúthien is well known. (Beyond their knowledge were the deeds of the Eagles in the war against Sauron: in the rescue of the Ring Finder and his companions, in the Battle of Five Armies, and in the rescue of the Ringbearer from the fires of Mount Doom.)\n6 For Maelor as a post-LR variant name of Maglor , see: III:353 and fn.; X:182 §41; and XII:318

Progression是今年新开的显然新非常非常多！造成的显著差异我能想到的就是在垫子外面有很多长椅可以休息，比hive直接坐地上更舒适一点，每个椅子旁边都配了长短的刷子用来刷粉。有很多单独的卫生间和浴室，甚至有理疗室， 当场受伤当场治疗……（不是），还提供高级莲蓬头和洗发水护发素护手霜。Hive毕竟是在工业园区的第一家，整体旧太多了，垫子是偏硬但受力较为均匀的感觉，progression的垫子非常软，下陷了多少和受力程度非常相关，总体感觉更不容易受伤。\n非常神奇的是，今天重新去Hive注意到光线非常暗，因为整体都没有窗户，而Progression在两条大路的corner unit，整体层高加上巨大的窗户，完全不需要室内光已经非常明亮了。\n因为Hive很少有人刷粉，整体感觉岩点更滑，但Hive似乎只能用液体镁粉？而Progression有很多干粉，空气质量应该是Hive更好。\n配套 除了上述的理疗室，progression还有一小块窗边的健身区域，设施除了更新之外和Hive差相仿佛；都有指力板和引体向上架子和弹力带；Hive只有一块全是岩点的墙，而且仰角对我来说很大了，Progression多了一块彩色分布的墙+一块仰角比较subtle的单色墙。Progression的商店区域略微大一些，卖些贵贵的粉袋和运动服装，甚至有野攀用的垫子。咖啡馆非常fancy！估计是方便买个daypass住在岩馆一天的人，每个座位几乎都有配小桌板，风景也非常好。\n周边活动aka爬完能去干嘛：progression可以逛中超、逛至少十个咖啡馆、逛至少三个vintage店，没有很大的mall和高端商场，但周边商铺都是上世纪风格的本地老店，旁边还有经常被提名van最好吃披萨的AJ；自行车友好，出门就是可以横穿整个van的e 10th。Hive，走一段路可以去知名冰淇凌店earnest和超大的MEC店，MEC店的二楼甚至有一面迷你攀岩墙。\n地理位置 这俩离天车站都有距离，progression从broadway/city hall要走20分钟，hive从main st/science world也差不多，但考虑到如果运气好，从broadway下车上99公交车是无缝衔接progression（如果expo line在commercial/broadway下车，去progression会更远，不过也可以用99 or 9路公交无缝衔接），而hive一路走过去都在吃卡车尾气也没有公交，那还是progression稍稍好一些吧……\n据说mellenium line 2026年会修到mount pleasant站也就是progression的门口，但请勿对效率抱太大信心！\n难度 经常听人说progression很硬，我自己第一次去是第三次爬，第一次单独爬，也能爬上大多数的v0，所以感觉也还好；上周五第三次去的时候已经能爬除了一条slab v1之外的所有v0/v1，而hive用的又是不一样的难度系统，所以还真不太有感知……？\n今天去hive确实极大提升信心，因为基本能flash hive1，爬上大多数hive2了，但hive2的跨度（v0-v2）太大，还有不少仰角线/平衡线/起步太高/起步被大多边形挡住的地方没有top。\n定线风格 首先最明显的是，hive多了很多低难度的线，而且线的密度似乎更高，今天爬到很多hive 1-3的线非常开心，而progression只有一条vb，10条不到的v0，和3-4条v1，以至于上次爬完v1后我甚至不得不去挑战v2？！但也似乎不是progression的高难度线就多，因为最高难度可以到v11，光拎一个难度比如v3-v5似乎每个级别的线也不多……\nprogression的每条线【风格】更明显，尤其是低难度线上经常出现手点在一整条线上都是类似形状，脚点也是，个人感觉大概是让新手习惯不同形状的点？Hive有些也有这种倾向，但总体我觉得一条线上的点更多样化。\n在progression v2最接近top的一条是在最后一个点力竭掉落，而其他线失败的地方也基本能感觉到明确的方向，尤其是力量不足蹭到指甲的地方；但hive今天好几条2上不去都是摸不着头脑型，比如比我高的人伸手就有，这种勉强还算提升力量可以克服的部分；但起点太高上不去、起点到第二个点有个巨大的把我整个人的厚度都挡住的多边形这种，就完全感觉不到什么思路……？\nHive的新线不标难度，而Progression会标但也会调整（不知道是否我记忆出错，把一条仰角v1在第二周改成了v2……），都是每周换一面墙，不过应该不管连续去哪个馆，像我这种不喜欢磕线的人都会无聊的。\n哦hive还有更多样化的墙！印象里progression是只有一面超大角度仰角，一面小角度仰角和一面slab，其他都是常规墙，同一高度，今天觉得hive明显高度不一样，有一开始常规后来变大slab的，各种仰角和在有角度的墙之间转换，特别高的墙，特别矮的墙，几乎完全和地面平行的仰角……很好玩，但也造成今天在hive2突然给我爬恐高了。\n价格 progression工作日11点前进场早鸟票$20，hive每个月第一个周一学生日票$15，因为现在维持着一周一去的频率，所以我都还在薅这俩选项，比学生月卡更便宜。\n两者连续包月价格类似，progression稍贵，但都附带每个月五次新人guest pass，progression还有一个聊胜于无的咖啡馆八折优惠（因为咖啡馆的产品本身溢价比较严重！）。\n以及上次在reddit看到一个可以买便宜票参加攀岩club的活动，叫badclimber，似乎比较松散，看起来是我会喜欢的活动，每周在van地区不同的岩馆有一次半价买daypass的机会：https://www.thebadacademy.com/bad-climbers\n人数和预定 不知道是不是今天周一都是学生，hive人挺多的，不过同一时间在actively爬的人不算多，就是还要注意走路不要撞人（对我来说难度极大的任务）。\nProgression人流从来没有很多过，不过大概到了下午会更多……\nHive比较让我问号的是为了控制人数每次都要预定，虽然我两次walk in都成功了，不过还是略微担心，以及进场前多一道要拍照的程序（waiver是两家都要签的，progression可以在ipad上自己电子签hhhh）。\n最后 我是真不擅长overhang和slab啊！在hive没爬上两格的slab，在progression剩下没能top的v1也是slab，基本都是站上去就无从伸手的状态，大概还是脚法不够踩不实的原因？\n","date":"2025-06-02T00:00:00Z","image":"//localhost:1313/post/hive-progression-bouldering-comparison/cover_hu_29c9e937c1f3b173.jpg","permalink":"//localhost:1313/post/hive-progression-bouldering-comparison/","title":"Hive

选有一定保障的牌子，显然尽量不要选国产。我是功能党，which means其实我也看不上一些非常温和甚至根本没啥用的主流牌子，比如欧莱雅兰蔻科颜氏雅诗兰黛资生堂lamer；但护肤品也不是说光有成分就够了额，比如前两年国产小牌子爆发性创业的时候就出现过维生素c精华变色快，没有加专门的防腐剂只靠一些溶剂的辅助防腐功能所以变质快，以及功效成分析出等等。如果一定要买小牌子，买那种稳定、功效经过长久验证、析出也没太大危险的成分，比如b5、保湿类成分、洁面、水杨酸和果酸等等；防晒虽然也很稳定，但小品牌的防晒肤感很难做好。\n所以我几乎exclusively地用the ordinary就很好理解了……便宜、溶剂稳定、肤感大多不咋样但我作为干皮不在意。但非常伤心的是自从前任ceo自杀+被雅诗兰黛收购后，the ordinary出的新品就越来越少，而且都是些又贵又华而不实的玩意儿，气死。\n其他开价品牌尽量不要用最便宜一档的，有效成分加太少了，稍微贵一点点（我的标准大概是精华20刀/30ml为上限，这个上限真的非常低了相信大家预算都比我高）的就可以，比如卡尼尔露得清艾维诺之类的。\n另一个选择是如果你在国内可以搜搜被大牌收购的国产品牌，比如大宝就被露得清收购了，打折的时候有款便宜防晒挺好用的。\n欧盟品牌比美国牌子好，欧盟对护肤品的新成分批准更快，同时对落后成分禁止也更严格，有个叫mit（真的叫mit）的防腐剂就是在欧盟已经禁用，但俄罗斯还能用，之后提到的二苯酮-3也是在美国还能用。而且法国和德国的药厂非常强悍，如果你在欧洲那你有福了，超市的自有品牌（比如德国的dm）都有可能是背靠大药厂的……天知道我有多羡慕……\n保湿部分 微博某些激进派博主（通常见于大油皮有强烈痘痘困扰的人中）会说绝大部分封闭保湿剂是不好的，刷酸提高细胞代谢率去除死角质才是对的，否则会减弱皮肤自身保水的能力，which和中文主流学日本拼命用保湿剂的风潮背道而驰。\n我对此不完全认同，毕竟你再给我腿上擦果酸提高自身保湿能力，我的腿该起皮还是起皮，以及我也真的没有大胆到给嘴唇刷酸。所以现在的思路大概是，脸上也会尽量少用非常封闭的保湿剂，比如一味堆叠各种甘油和醇的，但对身体不排斥。冬天晚上用天然提取的类油精华（角鲨烷or艾维诺的那款身体油喷雾），夏天晚上用the ordinary的b5精华，早上一律用the ordinary的NMF面霜，或者直接上化学防晒（不能用物理防晒因为我用了会拔干）。用角鲨烷是因为常年用的the ordinary 0.5% retinol的溶剂就是角鲨烷，一举两得；用b5是因为the ordinary有60ml大包装，便宜，而且b5本身是非常便宜、成熟、稳定的非封闭保湿剂；用NMF是因为，the ordinary连续两年11月买就送这款，不用额外花钱。\n身体保湿很大比重其实是，少用沐浴露，冬天可以用沐浴油，外加狂擦身体乳。身体乳的选择也是冬天油夏天乳这样的思路，我用下来感觉超市里最便宜的那种aveeno确实效果不太好，现在比较喜欢露得清的hydraboost夏天用，goldbond的几款冬天用，用亚马逊的keepa追踪折扣，基本降到12刀左右就可以买一瓶囤着，如果有比较严重的湿疹困扰，强烈推荐goldbond那款eczema relief，或者如果你舍得买eucerin，eucerin也有很多款eczema专用身体乳。\n清洁 北美市场太无聊了，清洁和防晒的所有产品成分大同小异，所以只要注意不要一不小心买到皂基（很难吧，只要不是直接买肥皂基本不会有皂基）就对我无害，比起氨基酸洁面，我现在会更多用复合成分的，比如婴儿沐浴露的两性清洁剂，当然也是因为婴儿沐浴露比成人洁面便宜多了，终极抠门法则。\n两性+氨基酸复合清洁剂对我这个超级干皮是足够用了，但如果你是油皮，比起直接用皂基的搓盘子感，或许用普通洁面+对角质有化学剥脱作用的水杨酸是更好的选择，这里最有名的是cerave的一款，毕竟是做水杨酸起家的公司（然而这个牌子在国内宣传最多的却是神经酰胺修护，亚洲人觉得自己即将烂脸每天都要修护的一生……）\n防晒 还是很无聊，简单来说干皮买化学防晒油皮买物理防晒（mineral）基本不会错，我用超市最便宜的。但防晒贵在坚持，以及物理防晒因为波段不全还是建议搭配帽子之类的使用；然而对于不讲究的人，防晒只要擦了就是胜利……如果去海边暴晒的地方建议补涂。\nand，防晒剂是否伤害珊瑚虽然不一定有定论，但并不是所有防晒剂的错……严格来说，基本只有日本和亚洲防晒会有【桂皮酸盐】这种potentially伤害珊瑚的成分，所以完全可以做到擦防晒但不伤害不管有没有科学依据……我真的不懂日本人为什么这么喜欢桂皮酸盐，基本走进一家店翻开成分表第一位一定是它，还容易引起辣眼睛过敏症状。还有如果一不小心买到美国牌子，记得看有没有二苯酮-3，非常落后的成分，比桂皮酸盐引起过敏和伤害珊瑚的成分都高一级。\n附送rant：tinorsorb这成分研发出来得快十年了吧，fda一直不批导致美国用不上也就算了，连累加拿大也用不到这个最新波段覆盖最广的防晒，气死我了，人欧洲都用了好多年了\n功效护肤 虽然有了三座法宝，但保湿清洁防晒其实也只能保证皮肤状况不恶化，如果你本身就有别的诉求，那也是很难帮你做到的……注意所有功效产品都需要搭配防晒使用，尤其是retinol，通常做法是晚上用retinol早上用酸和抗氧化产品。\n抗老 我对此几乎无需求，不要相信xhs那种十几二十岁抗初老的言论啦……有效成分是retinol（维A醇/视黄醇及其原型和各种衍生物）\u0026raquo;\u0026raquo;\u0026gt;胜肽\u0026raquo;\u0026raquo;\u0026raquo;\u0026raquo;其他所有号称能抗老的成分。\nretinol几乎是万能成分，但刺激性也大，需要配合防晒使用，这两点加起来让很多人害怕又心动（？），但我的经历是连续用一年基本可以耐受到the ordinary 0.5%的程度，这瓶虽然是0.5看起来浓度很高，甚至远高于欧莱雅0.3的强效一款，但由于溶剂是角鲨烷，实际刺激并没有那么大，证据是我用the ordinary 1%和obagi 0.5%都能脱皮（此处脱皮不是干燥引起的，是皮肤快速更新，imagine刚买到一个电子产品撕下保护膜的感觉），但用the ordinary 0.5%毫无感觉，每天用都不会发红。入门级的露得清软管retinol就挺好的。\n如果没有非常严重的痘痘困扰，不建议用国内很便宜的那种维A酸乳膏或者更强力的他扎罗汀，脱皮不是随便说说的，保护自己的皮肤……\n皮肤平整度 其实就是水杨酸（叫BHA或者salicylic acid）和果酸（叫AHA或者glycolic acid）。水杨酸对口的是黑头粉刺，这个成分也是非常成熟，和阿司匹林差不多一个年纪，都是柳树皮提取物，常见浓度0.5%-2%，最常见形式是棉片和护肤水，超市货架最底层一般都有且比较低端的品牌都一股薄荷味；果酸是应对皮肤更新和色素沉积，常见浓度2%-10%，甚至更高的也有（但那种就不建议日常使用了），最有名的牌子是芯丝翠，我有一管打折时买的身体乳，非常胶水味……但效果也很好。乳酸（PHA或者lactic acid）如果能买到浓度比较高或者和果酸复配的还是蛮好的，温和。\n用酸的另一个原因是酸能剥脱老废角质，让新细胞长出来，从而增强皮肤自己的保水能力。虽然这种内容很玄学，但我自己刷下来，功效以年计的确能看出效果，放六年前我不会想到在温哥华我能冬天不糊超厚重的封闭保湿剂，夏天能只用b5精华不用面霜……\n美白 很多年前就已经放弃的课题……简单来说成分太多样了搞不懂，也买不起，以及有果酸和A醇这两样最强力的我已经很满足，并不追求白成女鬼，也不想白成女鬼。377用过，无感；烟酰胺用过，无感，但据说对油皮来说有控油效果且效果比美白好。\n救急 如果是突发过敏红肿脱皮这种情况：停掉所有功效性产品，只用b5这种极度温和的保湿成分，或者你是油皮就什么都别用了，早上糊个矿物质物理防晒算完，减少对皮肤的刺激直到康复。\n如果是突然冒了个超大的痘/粉刺黑头突然超多这种激素性的问题：考虑用10%壬二酸，which是非常好但产品很少因为太难溶解以及渗透到皮肤里的成分。不幸的是加拿大的壬二酸是处方药，the ordinary虽然有这款产品（杜鹃花酸）但禁止销售……这个成分最有名的牌子是法国的皮尔法伯，但我用不起（泪\n锦上添花 除了retinol以外现在还流行非常多如火如荼的抗氧化产品！什么白藜芦醇、euk134、咖啡因，反正抗氧化成分汗牛充栋，我懒得用，对脸色及时白净效果也没有需求，什么都没有睡饱了黑眼圈淡了有效。\n其他部位护理 唇膏 我最喜欢至本的白色和紫色唇膏，过夜用不糊嘴且早上起来嘴唇不干，有替换装，外壳可以用很久，打折的时候也不贵，总之是我固定海运列表。\n如果冬天会特别特别干裂的嘴唇还是考虑用唇膜吧，但罐装的唇膜不免会需要用指甲舀，有些人会觉得不卫生。\n脖子 对没有问这种一到冬天就湿疹的困扰的人来说，脖子最重要的护理其实是，不要因为觉得有色差了就往脖子上糊很高浓度的retinol或者酸，因为（反直觉的是）脖子皮肤比脸还要脆弱！\n如果有湿疹，那务必每天老老实实糊eczema身体乳……不要偷懒……（虚弱\n护手霜 如果有功效要求就照着脸上那些要求糊吧，如果没有那其实大可以找一个香味喜欢、价格可以接受、外表也漂亮的随便用。护手霜是我为数不多觉得不用护肤专业品牌，那种香氛品牌（什么伊索之类的）也可以用的品类……我现在用的是goldbond桂花味那款。\n最后 所以我现在的routine是：\n晚上：水杨酸toner（st.ives，超市最便宜的牌子）+ the ordinary nmf面霜+隔天一次the ordinary 0.5 retinol（只用在下巴和眼周）\n早上：果酸toner + nmf面霜/防晒\n夏天会把面霜换成b5精华。\n如果有闲情逸致再考虑其他锦上添花的东西，目前还在消耗存货。\n","date":"2025-05-19T00:00:00Z","image":"//localhost:1313/post/skincare-routine/cover_hu_f7970d12e2577987.png","permalink":"//localhost:1313/post/skincare-routine/","title":"穷鬼+功效派护肤routine"},{"content":"看的实在太多了，仅记录一些非常推荐/留下深刻印象的\n龙风暴 我最最最喜欢的 silm 作者，给 silm 写了一百多篇，新教徒，所以不写任何黄文和男同，绝大部分是双梅双子亲情向和 ff 亲情向，但不知为何双梅双子的色情程度超越很多写 slash 的。\nTo Catch a Falling Star 有段时间堪称我全 silm 最喜欢的第一名，也是至今 Elrond\u0026amp;Maglor 这个 tag 下的热度第一。温馨伤感，明辉被安卡拉刚弄死后 Maglor 捡到了钻，和霍比特来到了林谷，与此同时明辉在曼督斯直奔找到费共同越狱。\nMemento Pugna 还在更新的系列。4th age 维林诺，费从曼督斯放出来后彻底失去了记忆，三芬对此感到崩溃，而 Elrond 坐船把 Maglor 从中土偷渡了回来……\nReprise \u0026amp; Resound Maglor time travel 的对称作，非线性叙事因此一开始有些难看懂，但双梅部分超萌。。。双梅姐必吃。。。。。\nScion of Somebody 星星身世说！\nAncient History AA 婚礼时 Maglor 来到刚铎，打算悄悄溜走但没有成功。\nFamiliar Strangers 又是我超级喜欢的一篇。。算了龙风暴每篇我都超级喜欢。熊熊在泪雨后重伤但没有死，被传送到了 3rd age 由阿拉贡捡到。明明大半篇幅都是熊熊单人视角，其实最后有超萌的 Elrond\u0026amp;Maglor。。。不看亏死。。。还有各种贡一旦和 1st age 扯上关系就浑身流汗的搞笑插入。\nThe Last Homely Hostel 龙风暴的 outsider pov 都是必看，明明是没什么情节（？）的 4th age 重逢文但就是萌得我泪流满面哇哇大哭\n龙风暴的实在太多了，其他我喜欢的还有 One Deed More, Unwell, Not Alone (Through All the Ages)，如果喜欢 FF 亲情向也可以看 We Dream of Truth, Like Tomorrow Won\u0026rsquo;t Arrive 等等，Maedhros\u0026amp;Gilgalad 有 windows of opportunity，费诺丹有 i see your wife with a man who is hunting 和 yours dearly, most sincerely 和 Stepford Smiles and Time Travel Wiles，卡兰哈烈丝 time travel 有 Your Eyes are Like Knives (And I Really Like Knives)，最近还在连载的 Elrond deage 文 you\u0026rsquo;re still young 也巨萌无比。。她每年都参加 b2mem 和 trsb，所以大概率 3 月和 8 月都有长文看！超级幸福，活下去的盼头+1\nThe Starlit Sky 非常古早的 ffn 文，随缘上有很不错的翻译，我写的文好像受这篇影响很大……还有 Elrond 看见 Maglor 前妻的画像宛如失恋这种不知道算是搞笑还是应该让我趁机嗑一口的桥段。\nLong are the waves 同样是很长时间内的最爱，但不敢重看因为非常 angst，明明是普通 Elrond 搜寻 Maglor 的情节但最后我 cp 也没有见上面，哭泣，只记得最后 Maglor 在 Elrond 西渡时远远目送他离去。太伤感了情节全部忘光了……\nThe proudest creation 费的鬼魂在钻里，只有双子能看到，从而阻止了双梅自杀。这个作者写过不少 Elrond/Celebrian/Gil-Galad OT3，kidnap fam 都写得很萌，但因为一篇写到穹对白羽（算是）口出恶言吧因此被中文同人女避雷过，笑死。不过 spacewall 最出名的一篇还是Maedhros 加入 fellowship的，里面的猫又帅又苏，虽然她写那篇的时候笔力还不是很够用。另一篇 Elrond 被奥克袭击（而不是银冠）西渡的文也很萌！忘了叫什么名字了（坦荡）\nElrond and his Feral Children 去年的新作者写的林谷系列文，作者是专业作者写 literary fiction 的，所以文笔细腻流畅又好读！更新非常勤奋，但现在连载的文是印度殖民地背景的架空 kidnap fam，我实在不能接受双梅有胡子，所以根本没看……另一篇原作双梅重生回林谷的cast in stone是极好的！\nGhosts of the first age Tillion 也是我非常喜欢的作者，有另一个系列的星星身世说 steampunk au！也很好看！不过明显她已经写这个系列写上瘾了，第一篇费\u0026amp;明辉是搞笑向，the sun also rises 是非常少见的 aroace russingon，这个猫特别 marred 特别怜爱，还有单独的 33 找小孩篇。最新篇是大杂烩，从 Elrond\u0026amp;Maglor 开始，中间变成费诺丹擦枪走火，又变成欧 3 偷情（虽然我不看欧 3 但这种，33 主导的风味真的非常少见）\nWhen the Sun is Nearly Blinding seaofeels 的所有费诺丹都巨萌无比，但作者貌似学业繁忙不写了，悲伤。其实没有 kidnap fam 的部分，这里的费加入 fellowship 绝对是最好的 fellowship fic 之一。\nOn Elrond Peredhel 在中文毫无水花（好吧其实这扫文 99%的文在中文 fandom 都毫无水花）的一个系列，因为作者是 Ham 跑过来的，特别擅长写 drama，drama 到我觉得穹都有点 ooc 了。而且这里作者对白羽完全是负面描写额，完完全全，负面到明辉为了保全和穹的亲情都和白羽离婚了（哈哈我看到这里也是大脑发光状，其他大脑发光情节还有什么明辉羡慕 Maglor 和 Elrond 的 quality time、Elrond 对 Turgon 面斥不雅和你们家没有关系！Elrond 和 Fingofin on first name basis 喊 Fingonfin nolo，都挺吓人的一刚。好像是还在更新但作者好像当青椒去了没空写文，而且我看到费镇压 russingon 的部分就缓缓跑特了，酌情观看吧……\nFires in the Winter 达芙妮跑跑长篇 russingon 巨作 what is wrought between us 的最后一篇，太虐了哎又是一个只敢看一遍系列，因为没打 relationship tag 一开始被我错过了，翻出之后就是缓缓流泪，寒风中吃着炸鸡看完最后一章的时候心情是，达芙妮跑跑你放过我吧，也放过买提猫吧……不过系列里据嗑 russingon 的香油说也有很甜的！（russingon 的一切甜都是为了泪雨后的 angst 铺垫= =\nThe Cleaving TheChasm 写的双梅亲情向，不是骨科胜似骨科了一刚。why。少见的买提猫依赖 Maglor 多于反过来的塑造，也比较 angst 但最后有一点点 comfort\nEvery Beautiful Thing 又是一个常见 trope 之，Elrond identified himself as 费诺里安，于是在 Elrond 取得钻之后双梅的誓言也被 fullfilled 了，写这个 trope 的几篇这篇是最好看的。作者最近在写 russingon+kidnap fam 的 canon divergence 文，喜欢 russingon 养小孩的有福了\nwhere no storms come 曾经相当喜欢的一篇，魔戒大战后 Maglor 鬼鬼祟祟地来到林谷想看一眼就走，就像无数其他同人一样立刻被 Elrond 抓住了！作者是学术界人士因此文笔非常不错，沉静隽永的感觉。\nScribeofArda 又是非常重量级的一位作者，从四年前写A Thread Unraveled开始就一直在拓展这个泪雨获胜的 au，至今没写完，对剧情的把控令人震撼，群像文的每个视角都丝丝入扣，不过最多的显然还是猫苏部分，有很大部分的盔弓盔和牌牌\u0026amp;Maeglin。把辛格写死了大快人心，不过作者也为此被微博读者蛐蛐\u0026amp;被匿名提问箱骚扰，我只想说不要因为人家写了其他视角就以为她不是精费兼猫苏啊，其实只要看过一点原文，绝对会发现作者更偏爱买提猫，甚至出现过 Maglor 说猫“是天生的政治家，要靠睡前策划战争才能睡着”这种 line，猫苏本性暴露无遗\nJouissant 以一己之力把双梅推到 silmkinkmeme 第一的双梅挚爱姐，可惜的是在英文写骨科注定要遭受热度 flop 的命运，作者十年前写的 star trek 演员 rps 就已经热度超高，然而写双梅文一点水花都没有……有篇 Maedhros 诱拐青少年 Elrond 的很好看！（你。\nWe will make this place our home 超长英国 70s 乡村 au kidnap fam 日常，写了五十几章好像 in universe 时间线连一年都没有过去，其中 adhd Maglor 和 asd Elrond 都非常写实，100%确定作者是谱系，搞笑的是我第一次看这篇文的时候竟然没有那种“卧槽这个 Elrond 是 asd 的话我不会也是吧？！”的 revelation。日常细水长流的生活，时不时插入老宅闹鬼警告，上次看到最新章的时候只记得熊熊是一战飞行员\nAnd what happened after 不是 kidnap fam 但也算是 silm 我觉得最值得看的文之一，a 太除了这篇正点的后日谈还写过安牌的镇圈之作赠礼，而且这篇后日谈的翻译非常、非常好，另一篇纵使汝等杀害之人尽数为汝求情的翻译也是！赞美水豚！\n古早文 ncfan 的系列 2010s 前后的 kidnap fam 文风格大概是，已经不会有人搞不清双子是双胞胎，大家差不多都知道了人物的昆雅名，但 trope 和风格都还比较古典，ncfan 是这种风格写得比较完善的作者……\nAs little might be thought silm 大概有一百篇叫 as little might be thought 和 as kind as summer

的讲为什么学生不再走路\u0026amp;骑车去学校和在北美郊区骑车为什么是可行的视频，又在小红书连续刷到几个关于安省省长福特想砍掉多伦多市中心自行车道的（典型华人风格）讨论，顿时又有点想写点骑车体验比较……\n个人骑车习惯 杭州： 小学学会骑车，初中三年骑车通勤，单程十几分钟到半小时；大学经常骑共享单车，放假的时候因为不再有自己的自行车也经常骑杭州市政府的小红车，但都是买奶茶啊吃饭啊这种任务，没有用来远距离（~四十分钟以上）日常通勤过。\n温哥华：去年夏天买了辆二手（maybe 三手？）自行车，之后半年也就每周去超市和游泳馆；今年搬家之后开始每天用自行车通勤。$70 买的是裸车，我自己在迪卡侬网购了车架、锁、脚踏、蹬脚和后篮并且自己安装了，后来又换了一个轮胎，哭泣，总成本约$250。（理论上夜晚骑车应该安装前后 led 灯，我还没有铃铛，这两样都让我妈给海运了，淘宝的自行车配件便宜太多……）\n基础建设 在这个排名里，杭州被列为全球骑行友好城市第七，而前十的其他城市都在欧洲，可见基础建设方面还是很有竞争力的！我觉得优势主要有：\n几乎所有车道都有自行车道，我很久之后才意识到不是每个城市都是人行道-自行车道-公交车站-机动车道（从里到外）的顺序…… 公共自行车。又称小红车，我小学还志愿活动擦过这玩意儿！有市民卡可以免费骑一小时，全城大概上千个借还点，可以靠快到一小时的时候还车再借规避一小时的限制，可以临时锁车。公共自行车的缺点：车的状况不一，新车明显比旧的好骑，有儿童座椅的车很少，热门地点经常没有空位还（可以机器操作一下延长半小时走到另一个停车点，但麻烦），app 很难用，我习惯用市民卡/公交卡，但还车有概率失败，失败后开始收费要打电话找客服。 共享单车也便宜而且竞争丰富，需要投入少量心力找便宜月卡买，我本科最便宜的时候能维持 2-10 块一个月，如果习惯用 app 操作比较流畅，有问题可以直接找客服；座椅等硬件维护稍微舒服一点，但车篮非常之浅基本没用（曾经把早饭三明治放在车篮，路过减速带时三明治从篮子里整个被震出去，被自行车前轮完整碾碎……）。 缺点是国内共有的侵占自行车道，以及所有车道都主要是电动车用的啦，在电动车大军里骑自行车有点危险。\n而温哥华是个基础建设缺点和优点都很明显的地方……\n缺点：\n这里的设计就是让自行车走小路，行人和机动车走大路，所以几乎没有任何大路有自行车道，我印象里只有 cambie 桥和 westminster hwy 有，即使有也经常是和人行道共用，或者两个方向只有一条道，或者视觉上不足一米宽，颠一下直接撞到人行道路缘。但小路都是居民区，我要去的地方都在大路上，所以行程末尾的几百米经常被汽车尾气熏倒、被卡车吓死、被后面的汽车按喇叭。每当此时我的内心 os：别怪我，要怪就怪政府不给修自行车道。（补充：这周上学骑车去 dt 刚经历了超级惊险事件……我的路线是小路转到 cambie（按理说不应该骑 cambie 而应该骑另一条小路，但那条小路因为修天车路口被封了），过 cambie 桥到 dt。这周 cambie 桥的施工进展到把右边的自行车道和人行道都封了，我在上桥之前看到了自行车 detour 的路标是指着桥上的，还看到了 bicycles on roadway 的标志，以为就是让我和汽车一起的意思……没想到进城的这边只剩一个车道了！于是我用 20km/h 的时速把所有汽车都堵在身后……发出惨叫，下来后心率上 170 了。其实汽车很礼貌也没有鸣笛，但太刺激了我再也不走这条道了（。 上下坡很多，每次从学校骑回家，我吭哧吭哧……到 1st ave 了……吭哧吭哧……到 5th ave 了……再吭哧……不行了我要停下来休息一下。而且根本上给机动车设计的道路本来就会让自行车骑上面颠簸很多，我的车锁在篮子里发出巨响…… 哦还有偷车猖狂，虽然我用 U 型锁没有被偷过，但前几天到 DTES 逛街不到五分钟看到俩拿着单独一个车架的人，吓得我赶紧走了。 我没有用过 Rogers/mobi 的 bike share，价格还算合理，一年单次一小时免费是$169 的年费，在 dt 和 dt 外围借还点比较多，也有电力的，不过据 reddit 说也是维护不及时\u0026amp;头盔经常被偷的老问题。完全没有普及到 city 以外的地方。 优点：\n维护得还行，如果临时修路会标出 detour 路线，不会莫名其妙被停车位占领。几乎所有场所门口都有锁车的地方，但只适用于逛街，如果长时间停留还是停有门禁的车库吧。 温哥华可以把自行车带上天车和公交，公交会有司机协助，天车每个车厢有固定位置。 这么说感觉温哥华完全不行了呢！其实貌似在加拿大是仅次于蒙特利尔和渥太华的骑行友好城市了……小路上还是有不少自行车道的，路况和天气好的话甚至可以放手骑车玩一下（危险动作请勿模仿）。\n道路素质 温哥华完胜。初中骑车上学，每到稍大一点的红绿灯必有电动车中年男停下来抽烟。\n温哥华强制佩戴头盔，杭州好像电动车也强制了，但自行车……也许不？特别明显的是温哥华骑车的【专业】很多，大家不是抱着通勤这样的目的骑的……遇到的人十有八九都是山地车+骑行裤+头盔+水杯这样的配套，二手自行车也普遍有档位调整，没有车架、蹬脚、篮子等国内常见的配件，甚至 rogers 的共享单车都可以调整档位。理论上自行车和机动车享有完全相同的责任和义务，所以大家转弯都会打手势啊礼让行人之类的。我一方面不喜欢这种运动一下就要专门买装备的做法，觉得应该蕴锻炼于无形，随意一点，另一方面不得不承认国内超高比例的电动车/自行车比例其实也是大家负担不起汽车而已。\n其他 俩地方都有不适合骑车的季节，杭州夏天被热死，冬天被风吹死，温哥华冬天没那么冷，但天天下雨，而且这里的人跟感觉不到雨一样，穿冲锋衣把帽子撩起来都是给雨面子了，而近视的我内心疯狂尖叫。下雨打伞很危险，尤其是上下坡和急刹车的时候，但雨披解决不了水滴脸上（。\n曾经西湖可以骑车环湖，现在环湖一圈全部圈为步行区，自行车不让进。相比之下还是 Stanley Park 和 Seaside 更美好！但温哥华很多号称（路程）适合骑车的 trail，比如 Iona Beach 和 Terra Nova 到 Garry Point Park 那段其实都是石子路，骑车会有阻力。\n","date":"2025-04-06T00:00:00Z","image":"//localhost:1313/post/vancouver-hangzhou-cycling-experience-comparison/cover_hu_298741b7ceffe36e.jpg","permalink":"//localhost:1313/post/vancouver-hangzhou-cycling-experience-comparison/","title":"温哥华\u0026杭州骑行体验比较"},{"content":"AO3

chatgpt 应该还是好点的，毕竟会改句子顺序之类的，对自己 storytelling 技巧有点信心的用到这步即可，我有好不容易想提高预算改结构，结果 editor 没有理解的我思路改错方向了，最后还得我自己改回来的经历。\nCV 强烈推荐用 overleaf 找 latex 模板做，不会 latex

陆本基本是学生自己写完后给老师看，看完拜托老师收到邮件后上传的，不催就主动上传的属于很好的，对授课硕而言，属于强推不一定有用，但黑推估计有反作用……不过陆本基本不会有黑推，毕竟有就业率指标。\n有的老师会转发邮件让学生自己上传，其实还是有一点点风险的，学校能查到 ip，如果和 applicant 本人一样会被发现，只是大多数学校不查。\n申请过程 最终申了的项目 SFU MPCS：Master of Science in Professional Computer Science (MPCS)\n10.22 提交申请\n4.26 Rej\n学费 4w 出头，包括医保公交卡等。\n今年门槛突然暴涨的项目，去年录取样本大概是 985 85+ or 海本 80+，今年夸张到有人被 Yale 收了被 SFU 拒了……偏好海本明显，今年之前项目内部的三个方向放在同一个专业下，毕业 title 相同，今年扩招改成了三个专业 master of big data/computer vision/cybersecurity，因此尚未出现在每年 11 月更新的 bcpnp 列表上，学校表示更新时就会加上。我觉得这点风险很小不用太担心。 学制 16 个月，三学期上课+一学期 coop，学费总计约 4w CAD，在 burnaby 山上，生活成本相对较低但交通不便。\n三个方向前两个都偏机器学习，非实用找工型，一亩三分地有人 控诉 workload 太大以及被迫必修不相关的课，如果是和这位一样超级无敌功利，恨不得不上课整天刷题的可以谨慎考虑，其他人群如果门槛达到可以申，是 bcpnp 中仅次于 UBC ECE Meng 第二热门的项目，在加西也有较好的 reputation。Btw，SFU 科研最强的方向貌似是传媒和 Computer Vision，还有一个被我当作梦校的理由是有个 autism lab！不过我这种背景被脆据也不奇怪啦，以及其实并不是很想做机器学习方向……申请后会让填问卷选方向，我选的是 computer vision 但最热门的是 big data\nUVIC MADS：Master of Applied Data Science\n10.20 提交\n11 月 under review by department\n3.1 offer\n相对冷门的数据科学项目，总学费 3.8w CAD，连上 12 个月（三学期）课，上完后可选择性 coop。 感觉加西有存在感的大学也只有 UBC, SFU 和 UVIC 了，因此其实是在这个项目和最后去的 NEU 中犹豫过的，优势是本地 rep 较好、校园环境完善、生活成本低、课程自己喜欢；劣势是不在大城市、没法学期中找实习、非纯 CS title。最终还是屈服于 city animal 本性给拒了。 门槛相对较低，commitee 对国内院校等级应该所知不多，基本均分过 80 就能录，申请 ddl 也挺晚的。 UVIC 另有两个和 MADS 差不多的项目，ECE Meng 需要陶瓷且套到了就十拿九稳，有 10 月份就发 offer 的前例；MTIS 不需要陶瓷，但是 security 相关，不是很感兴趣。\nNEU MSCS (CSG)\n10.27 提交\n11.15 补材料\n2.20 offer\n大名鼎鼎的技校项目，我录的 general 比 align 少上一年课；申请的时候因为新系统 bug 到最后也没付申请费。\n雅思要求比较奇怪是 7.5（6），猜测是因为美国学校不懂雅思标准所以总分要求很高。\n学费两年总计 4w6 CAD，不包括任何东西纯学分费用（医保公交卡均不包，我甚至不确定 NEU 学生能不能用学生价买公交月卡），如果努力可以做 2 次 coop，align 甚至可以更多，因此 coop 工资也能 cover 一部分费用，但 1 实习工资要扣税；2 市中心生活成本非常高，所以最好还是先不要太低估预算。\nbar 比较玄学，体感是越早交门槛越低，虽然直到 4 月 ddl 也没截止，甚至还在发申请费优惠券，但到这个阶段基本就是想看看有没有前期全聚德背景很厉害的人来补申了，背景一般的很可能被发配去 Arlington/Portland 校区。\n由于美国私校赚钱项目商业化程度很高，webinar 每周中文答疑无微不至，我邮箱里全是广告，发 offer 后会热情邀请参加 virtual orientation，但有问题的话邮件全是自动回复，真正的人工回复至少等一周到半个月不等，据说今年扩招明显教学质量难以保证。\n（教学楼在市中心租写字楼的分校不要指望太多。\n总之就是功利性极强的选择，workload 因人而异，去年及以前的风评都是翻转课堂非常水不如不上，今年开始突然有大于两个人开始说 workload 很大云云，但根据 poa 上写的每周上课 8 小时来看多不到哪里去。\nUAlberta ECE Meng\n11.14 提交\n3.15 要求更新成绩单\n3.24 系 offer\n4.5 正式 offer\n也算是相对热门但门槛没那么高的项目之一，UA 全加拿大大学中 QS 排第四（100 多），外加生活成本低、门槛相对较低，去年至少有 10 个左右中国人去读的样子。\nECE Meng 作为授课硕当然也算边缘项目，申请时要从 8 个方向中选，真正和 CS 相关的方向比较少只有 2 个，其他都是医学/嵌入式/硬件等等，热门方向可能门槛也较高。\n会发邮件问本科期间上过的 ECE 相关课程，我其实没上过多少，在极长的表格里挑了和数字逻辑、计算机组织与结构、电子工艺相关的写了，类似于课程描述，要写大纲和成绩。\n学费不便宜，印象里大于 4w，但生活成本因为气候恶劣而一骑绝尘得低，学校附近 studio 大概是 1000/月，在温哥华得价格翻倍吧。\n麻烦之一是 alberta 省省提名要求从事对口工作至少半年，虽然两年项目给三年工签，但对口工作还是多了一些限制。\n接了 offer 就会开始选课，抢课似乎比较困难，毕竟要优先 CS 院，不幸抢到硬课可能会学得很痛苦（说我），但如果对科研感兴趣，UA 的强化学习是强势方向。\nUWaterloo System Design\n11.2 提交\n2.1 要求补 GRE\n3.9 Reject\n滑铁卢的相对冷门项目，称得上这两年热门的 ECE Meng 平替，同样是 16 个月连轴转上课，学费也一模一样，唯一区别是这个项目要！GRE！\n申请的时候系统极其难用，需要在至少 3 个网页中反复跳转，最后跳到 quest 系统里交材料，但 ps 无法直接上传 word，而是需要根据问题分段填写，问有没有科研的时候我都写的无。\n二月初来问我有没有交 GRE，愣住了，因为去年这个项目有无 GRE 录取的例子，当时考已经来不及了，因此和 committee 纠缠了几封邮件（包括后来说我们交 gre 的 ddl 可以推迟到三月下旬等）还是吃了拒信。\n相比 ECE Meng 离 CS 更远一点，项目名也奇奇怪怪，没有 schedule break 无法实习，但最后一学期可以只选一门课 part time 打工，但如果 23 年后不再允许每周工作 40h，那就不能全职实习了，而 CS 的兼职实习很少。\n毕业后可走 OINP，因为同时是 STEM+非多伦多地区，英语分数考高点基本不用工作也能被捞了。大多数人估计会跑去多伦多找工作。\nUBCO MDS\n11.26 提交\n4.4 reject\n恶评很多但还是很多人趋之若鹜的项目，总计 10 个月还 8 个月，可走 BCPNP，在温哥华本校区和基洛纳都有这个项目，课程安排 intense 且无假期，号称 accelerated 课程可申 3 年毕业工签，温哥华校区有 NLP 方向的额外选择。学费印象里不便宜，具体恶评直接搜小红书或一亩三分地均可。留位费也要几千刀。\nUBC 看不起我（。）的典型例子，温哥华校区因为我 gpa 差硬性标准 0.几，但即使达到了，以 UBC 这几年的热门程度也是不够 bar 的，所以退而求其次申了分校，早早 subitted 后快半年没有 review，然后直接发了模板拒信，并且申请费是和 UVIC 差不多，所有学校里最贵的。\n基洛纳车程离温哥华四小时，人口二十万，基本就是小镇生活了，我当初还犹豫过如果都有 offer 这个和 UVIC 去哪个（……）。\n理论上来讲分校和本校共享排名，所以甚至可以毕业后申英国 HPI 和荷兰 search year visa，但都 bcpnp 了估计没人会申这两个的。\n做了功课但最终没申的项目 UBCO EE Meng，UVic ECE 特点是都要陶瓷，都是科研硕，都偏 EE 而非 CS。 科研硕不用学费，生活费勉强能 cover，但能不能实习取决于导师人品，毕业要求高，我没有科研追求且恐导师，so 一开始就放弃了。\nUToronto MI (Master of Information) 传说中的水硕，加本 gpa 很低也能进，方向多样化，最接近 CS 的是信息管理和 UI/UX，其他方向是图书馆学类的。 名声好听，学费很贵，OINP 无地区加分，找工全靠自己努力，简单来说就是学费略微超出我预算上限了。\nWindsor University MAC (Master of Applied Computing) 也是著名保底项目之一，发 offer 很快，滚动录取，留位费高达 4000CAD 还是 8000（劝退我的最大因素），和 Waterloo SyDe 一样可走 OINP，gpa 门槛 75 相对友好。 其实本地名声不差，给我改文书的 editor 之一就是温莎本科 McGill 文学博士，对面就是底特律，如果一直在温莎工作还挺方便美加两边跑的，现在跨境通勤（拿美国工资住在加拿大）的似乎主要是印度人。\nUOttawa MSCS/ECE UOttawa 纯 CS 方向的项目有不止一个，其中一个和 Carleton 合作，两个没研究出什么区别干脆没申。学费平均水平，学校名声很好，就业机会在安省估计仅次于多伦多，但因为身为首都或许有一些信息安全的 concern 似乎不是很喜欢中国候选人，今年看到不少被脆据的。\nDalhousie University 本来打算申的似乎也叫 Applied Computing，需要面试，学校名声不错，学费适中，生活费很省，相对应的工作机会也少一点，不太了解海洋省省提名但应该不难。因为不想准备面试没申，看反馈面试主要问的是 Java。 另有一个项目叫 Internetworking，显然和 CS 更不相关，但门槛更低，寄托上有若干案例。\nCalgary University 因为本科和我校有交流项目却被疫情搞黄了的学校，想起来去看了一眼发现有接受理工科背景（非 CS）申请的项目，也有一个 10 个月的 DS 项目，均因时间太短无法拿到 3 年工签放弃了。\nDigital Media BCIT/UBC/SFU/Emily Carr 四校联合项目，不确定在不在 bcpnp 上（但很多 digital media 和 HCI 项目在），名声应该挺不错的，但需要作品集，也欢迎 CS 背景的人申，但我没有作品集。\nTompson River University/University of Northern British Columbia 都是 bcpnp 上的无名学校，前者有个 DS 项目，后者有个 CS，学费还都不便宜。因为在小镇上（9w 人）都被我率先排除了。\nNYIT/FDU 和 NEU 一样唯三在 bcpnp 上的美国私校额，但这两个即使放在美国也是 literally 野鸡校了，和 NEU 一样都是市中心租写字楼的 campus。NYIT Cybersecurity 似乎要求已经提高了，要求 GPA3.0 + 理工背景，FDU 还可以算是“转码”。印象里留位费很贵。适合对学校名声全无追求只想要枫叶卡的去，寄托上有个硕士在帝国理工 CS 的二硕在 UBC 和 NYIT 里选了后者的，因为可以一年毕业。\nMUN 纽芬兰纪念大学，在偏远到不能再偏远的 St John\u0026rsquo;s，学费非常便宜（一年几千 CAD）。名声应该也还可以。 但这个校的 CS 硕分两个，一个 Computer Science 12.1 截止，我看到的时候已经错过了，发 offer 很快；另一个 Software engineer 到次年三月截止，想了想还是没申…… 就业环境应该不能更差了，唯一听说过的互联网公司是 IBM 分部，毕业生估计都跑多伦多了。一年下六个月雪。\n前期费用 申请费（总共 6 个项目）：约 4300RMB\n文书修改（推荐信*3 + CV*1 + PS * 2）：约 740RMB\n雅思：2170RMB\n总计约 7200RMB\n","date":"2023-05-17T00:00:00Z","image":"//localhost:1313/post/test-chinese/cover_hu_74e40d5f101b6748.jpg","permalink":"//localhost:1313/post/test-chinese/","title":"泛CS跑路向23fall加拿大申请总结"}]
